3324	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0523."What… are you saying…? What…"
3325	Doremi@r@vdoremi0545."You've always been such a princess — you still are. …So just keep being one."

3330	Doremi@r@vdoremi0546."Just stay there for now, like a damsel in distress."
3331	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0524.@z150."GHWAAAaAaAAAH!! HURRY!! FREE MEEeE!!"
3332	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0525.@z113."I TOLD YOU SHIT FOR BRAINS TO FUCKING SAAVE ME ALREADYYYyYyY, AAAaAaH!!!"
3333	Doremi@r@vdoremi0547."The @b.@<Judges@> are me and Mina, right?"
3334	Mina@r@vmina0515."That's right…"
3335	Doremi@r@vdoremi0548."Listen. If you ask me, I think what matters the most is that we can all escape."
3336	Doremi@r@vdoremi0549."But in order to do that, we've gotta come to a decision now."
3337	Doremi@r@vdoremi0550."First, we escape this room. Once we're outside, maybe we can find something we can use to save Fuuka."
3338	Doremi@r@vdoremi0551."And of course… that boy over there as well."
3339	Boy@r@vm_shou0023."………"
3340	Doremi@r@vdoremi0552."There's nothing in this room. Arguing here would be the most useless thing we can do right now."
3341	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0526.@z138."You intend to let me die, don't you?! Doremi, you murdereeeeeeeer!!!"
3342	Doremi@r@vdoremi0553."…With you, it's always me doing stuff for you and getting nothing in return. It's been like this for a long time… for a long time now…!"
3343	Doremi@r@vdoremi0554."Mina! Declare her guilty! Hurry!"
3344	Mina@r@vmina0516."N-no way… M… Mina can't do that…"
3345	Doremi@r@vdoremi0555."You wanna save Fuuka? Well then, this is the only way!"
3346	Doremi@r@vdoremi0556."Fuuka isn't the kind of kid you think she is! She's always, always been looking down on you!"
3347	Mina@r@vmina0517."…F-Fuuka-chan wouldn't think of me like that…"
3348	Karin@r@vkarin0566."Whoa, whoa whoa, the soles of my shoes are getting burnt! They're melting!!"
3349	Karin@r@vkarin0567."There's no time, none at all! What do we do…!!"
3350	Doremi@r@vdoremi0557.@z150."…MINA! HURRY!!"
3351	Mina@r@vmina0518.@z150."a-AAaH… AAAaAAaAAAaH…!!"
3352	Mina@r@vmina0519."…*Huff*, *huff*…"
3353	Mina@r@vmina0520."Listen… Fuuka-chan…"
3354	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0527."…Aah, Mina-chan. You're the only one who has always been kind to me…"
3355	Mina@r@vmina0521."I promise…"
3356	Mina@r@vmina0521a."Once I'm out of here, I'll look for a key… and I'll come right back… I promise…!"
3357	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0528."…Mina…"
3358	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0529.@z172."EEeEEEaAAAAAaAAAH!!!"
3359	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0530.@z172."I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FUCKING PROMISE!!!"
3360	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0531.@z116."NOW LISTEN UP!! DECLARE ME NOT GUILTY AND FREE ME THIS INSTANT!!!"
3361	Mina@r@vmina0522."…! Fuu… ka…"
3362	Mina@r@vmina0523."Just… trust me…"
3363	Mina@r@vmina0524.——Guilty.
3364	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0532.@z116."MINAAAaAaAA!! YOU TRAITOOOOoOoOOR!! I'LL NEVER TRUST YOU, I'LL NEVER TRUST A BITCH LIKE YOU!!"
3365	@rAs soon as the @b.@<Judge@>, Mina, declared her guilty, the mechanism in Fuuka's torture chair activated, and the torture lever revealed itself.
3366	Doremi@r@vdoremi0558."Thank you, Mina. …Next comes my job."
3367	Doremi@r@vdoremi0559."As the other @b.@<Judge@>, only I can operate this torture lever."
3368	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0533."…We're… friends, aren't we…? How can you just… torture me…?"
3369	Doremi@r@vdoremi0560."Because we're friends, I ask you to endure it, Fuuka."
3370	Doremi@r@vdoremi0561."Otherwise, all of us will die."
3371	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0534."Aren't we… supposed to be best friends…"
3372	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0535."…You wouldn't touch… something as terrifying… as a torture lever…"
3373	@rAt this point, a horrifying heat is boiling up.
3374	@rThe blue flames under the mesh are all increasing in strength at once.
3375	@rThere might not even be one minute left…!
3376	Karin@r@vkarin0569.@z150."WAAaAAaAAAH, IT'S NO GOOD, IT'S NO GOOoOoOOD!!"
3377	Mina@r@vmina0525.@z150."SAVE ME MOMMY, MOMMY, AAaAH, AAAAaAAaHN!!!"
3378	Doremi@r@vdoremi0562."…Sorry Fuuka. I mean it. There's no other way besides this."
3379	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0536.@z150."GET YOUR FUCKING HAND OFF THAT LEVER, YOU SIMPLETON!!"
3380	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0537."A shit for brains bitch like you can't make a fucking judgement like this yourself!! Just do what I fucking tell you!!"
3381	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0538.@z150."AAAAAAAH— AGHHHHHHHHH AGHHHH AAKGHHHH!!!"
3382	@rDoremi's hand… is slowly pulling down the torture lever.
3383	@rWithout looking at anything, without listening to anything, with her eyes tightly shut… she is slowly pulling it down.
3384	@rThis activates some kind of terrifying mechanism, and a blood-curdling shriek resounds from Fuuka that they can't believe is really her voice.
3385	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0539."Khhhhhhh— ah— aaah, a, gh…!!!"
3386	@rThey're not sure what exactly is happening to Fuuka.
3387	@rAn unsettling sound can be heard, but from the outside, it doesn't seem like anything has changed.
3388	@rHowever, Fuuka's entire body shakes and violently convulses, her eyes open wide… forgetting even how to blink as she continues howling.
3389	@rFinally, even her throat is broken from her shrieking, and in its place, something that isn't quite saliva or foam spills out of her…
3390	Mina@r@vmina0526."……Fuuka-chan, @z150.FUUKA-CHAaAaAaaN!!@z100."
3391	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0540."Khh, gh, ………! ………— …………!!!"
3392	Doremi@r@vdoremi0563."*Huff*, *huff* *huff*!!!"
3393	Karin@r@vkarin0570."Ah… look!! The elevator door!!"
3394	Doremi@r@vdoremi0564."The collars?! This screw-like thing is turning!"
3395	Mina@r@vmina0527."…*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*, *huff*…!!"
3396	Karin@r@vkarin0571."Mina! Don't just stand there! Get your collar off…!"
3397	@rNow that the torture lever was pulled all the way down, a small mechanical sound can be heard in their collars, and the screws in their collars start turning.
3398	@rThe turning stops, and the collars fall to the floor with a heavy clanking noise.
3399	@rThere's no more time to worry about anything. The girls, having gotten their collars off, take off into the elevator.
3400	@rKarin and Mina leap in first, and then, Doremi enters and turns around.
3401	@rLeft there alone, Fuuka's eyes meet Doremi's.
3402	@rFuuka, with thick blood flowing from the sides of her mouth… is gazing faintly at Doremi.
3403	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0541."………"
3404	Doremi@r@vdoremi0565."…Bye-bye, Princess Fuuka."
3405	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0542."…a… a… a…"
3406	Doremi@r@vdoremi0566."Serves you right. What a relief."
3407	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0543."…Then… now…"
3408	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0544."Will… you… forgive… me…?"
3409	Doremi@r@vdoremi0567."………"
3410	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0545."…I'm… gonna die… if I… stay here…"
3411	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0546."Can't you… at least… forgive me…?"
3412	Doremi@r@vdoremi0568."………"
3413	Doremi@r@vdoremi0569."…Sure, I guess so. Alright, when you die, I'll forgive you."
3414	Doremi@r@vdoremi0570."So hurry up and,"
3415	Doremi@r@vdoremi0571."Die."
3416	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0547."…Hehehe,"
3417	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0548."…Hahahaha… haa-hahahahahahaha…"
3418	@rAt last, the flames under the floor burst out in columns.
3419	@rIt's no longer just the hot air — the flames are now burning Fuuka directly. The stench of her burnt hair fills the room.
3420	@rThe elevator door starts to close, slowly.
3421	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0549."(…Doremi. Do you really think you can become a group of close childhood friends… now that you've eliminated me, the one you hate?)"
3422	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0550."(Even though you're hated yourself… by those close friends…)"
3423	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0551."(I was unlucky… so I was left behind to die, but…)"
3424	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0552."(If… the @b.@<Condemned@> had been you… it would've been you being abandoned by us…)"
3425	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0553.@z150."HAHA, HAA-HAHAHAHAHAHAA-HAA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA…!!"

# 05_gameB前半02 (first half 02)
3426	@rFuuka, showered in Doremi's verbal abuse, is dumbfounded, as if overcome with dizziness…
3427	Doremi@r@vdoremi0572."…*Huff*… *huff*… *huff*."
3428	Doremi@r@vdoremi0573."Mina. Karin. …Look at the clock. There's not even 2 minutes left."
3429	Doremi@r@vdoremi0574."So among the three of us, let's decide by majority."
3430	Karin@r@vkarin0572."………"
3431	Mina@r@vmina0528."Decide what by majority…?"
3432	Doremi@r@vdoremi0575."Whether the four of us die as good friends,"
3433	Doremi@r@vdoremi0576."Or the three of us survive as good friends."
3434	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0555."…I guess you're… abandoning me…"
3435	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0556."Haha… haha…"
3436	Karin@r@vkarin0573."I… I don't want to abandon you or anything, Fuuka…"
3437	Karin@r@vkarin0574."It may not be the case for Doremi but… even now, you're still my best friend."
3438	Doremi@r@vdoremi0577."Fuuka is always talking about you behind your back. Didn't you know, Karin?"
3439	Karin@r@vkarin0575."Eh…"
3440	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0557.@z150."THAT'S NOT TRUE, SHE'S WRONG!! IT'S NOT TRUE, KARIN, TRUST ME…!!"
3441	Karin@r@vkarin0576."………"
3442	Karin@r@vkarin0577."…It's okay, Fuuka. I trust you."
3443	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0558."…Karin…"
3444	Karin@r@vkarin0578."I've known you longer than anyone else. Maybe there were times when there was a thing or two worth grumbling about."
3445	Karin@r@vkarin0579."But even now, you're still my best friend, because I trust you."
3446	Doremi@r@vdoremi0578."…Are you serious about that? She had those feelings for a long, long, very long time. you know?"
3447	Doremi@r@vdoremi0579."Fuuka really hated you."
3448	Karin@r@vkarin0580."Cut it out, Doremi. Aren't you just scheming to get us to abandon Fuuka?"
3449	Karin@r@vkarin0581."Everyone, you're all just panicking because of these extreme circumstances. Of course, you are too, Doremi!"
3450	Karin@r@vkarin0582."You must be hurt too, Fuuka, but please, forgive Doremi!"
3451	Karin@r@vkarin0583."Whatever you said about me is in the past now! I forgive you."
3452	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0559."…Karin… Karin… *sob*…"
3453	Doremi@r@vdoremi0580."………"
3454	Doremi@r@vdoremi0581."…What's your opinion, Mina?"
3455	Mina@r@vmina0529."M-M-M-Mina… Mina…"
3456	Karin@r@vkarin0584."…Well, you are the @b.@<Joker@> after all."
3457	Karin@r@vkarin0585."In your position, it'd probably be better if Fuuka, the @b.@<Condemned@>, was the one everyone hates."
3458	Mina@r@vmina0530."…*sob*…"
3459	Doremi@r@vdoremi0582."…Mina?"
3460	Mina@r@vmina0531."M… Mina also… feels the same as… Karin-chan…"
3461	Mina@r@vmina0532."…I mean, Karin-chan and Doremi-chan are both the @b.@<Judges@>, right…?"
3462	Doremi@r@vdoremi0583."………"
3463	Doremi@r@vdoremi0584."…If the two @b.@<Judges@> have different opinions, there's no way we can pull the torture lever to save the three of us."
3464	Mina@r@vmina0533."Then… do the four of us die… or do the four of us look for a way to be saved, those are the only two choices…"
3465	Karin@r@vkarin0586."Mina…"
3466	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0560."…Karin… Mina-chan… thank you… *sob*"
3467	Doremi@r@vdoremi0585."………"
3468	Doremi@r@vdoremi0586."…*Huff*."
3469	Doremi@r@vdoremi0587."In that case, the only thing we can do is look for a way for the four of us to survive…"
3470	Doremi@r@vdoremi0588."…Eh? …What's this."
3471	Doremi@r@vdoremi0589."Hey, Karin, Mina. …Can you take a look at this for me?!"
3472	@rDoremi, looking at the boy's cage nonchalantly, suddenly raises her tense voice.
3473	Karin@r@vkarin0587."Wh-what happened…?!"
3474	Mina@r@vmina0534."What? Did something happen?!"
3475	Doremi@r@vdoremi0590."…It's this part of the bars…. See what I mean?"
3476	Karin@r@vkarin0588."Eh? What? Eh?"
3477	Doremi@r@vdoremi0591."If it's like I imagine…. ………"
3478	Mina@r@vmina0535."Wh-what's that mean…?"
3479	Karin@r@vkarin0589."I don't get it but… there's only a little over a minute left…"
3480	Karin@r@vkarin0590."Whatever you found, Doremi, all we can do is bet on it…!"
3481	Doremi@r@vdoremi0592."…The question is how to go about this. …Hmmm…"
3482	Doremi@r@vdoremi0593."All we can do is bet on this method…"
3483	Doremi@r@vdoremi0594."Karin. Mina. …Help me out."
3484	Karin@r@vkarin0591."I-I'll do anything you need me to! What should I do?"
3485	Doremi@r@vdoremi0595."…Mina, you stand there and grip those bars with both hands."
3486	Doremi@r@vdoremi0596."Hold on tightly, alright? And you, Karin, stand here and grip these bars."
3487	@rKarin and Mina still seem to have no idea what Doremi's plan is.
3488	@rIt's understandable. Doremi just doesn't have the time to explain her crazy plan, it seems.
3489	@rThe pair, gathered at one corner of the boy's hanging cage, tightly grip the bars with both hands, as instructed.
3490	Doremi@r@vdoremi0597."You two, don't move, okay…? Now, we take Mina's chain…"
3491	@rDoremi follows the chain on Mina's collar, coiling up the remaining length, and passes it through the bars on one corner of the cage.
3492	@rThen, the chain is made into a ring and hung around Karin's neck.
3493	Karin@r@vkarin0592."…Just what the hell is this…?"
3494	Doremi@r@vdoremi0598.——Not guilty.
3495	@rThe next instant, something happens that no one imagined. …With the exception of Doremi.
3496	@rDoremi has declared her not guilty, as a @b.@<Judge@>.
3497	@rBecause of that, the @b.@<Condemned@> and the @b.@<Joker@> switch places.
3498	@rMina, the @b.@<Joker@>, is made the @b.@<Condemned@>, and the chain on her collar is reeled in, pulling her body toward the torture chair with incredible force.
3499	@rHowever, the chain runs through the bars of the hanging cage as it tries to pull Mina into her torture chair, and coils around Karin's neck…
3500	Mina@r@vmina0536."…Khee… ghee…!"
3501	Karin@r@vkarin0593."Hnngh… gh… kh…!"
3502	@rThe chain is being reeled in, with terrifying force, to drag Mina over to the torture chair.
3503	@rHowever, the chain instead pulls Karin's neck into the bars.
3504	@rSo, both Karin and Mina's necks are… being squeezed with terrifying force…
3505	Doremi@r@vdoremi0599."…You really are idiots. …And I even told you how the 3 of us could survive."
3506	Doremi@r@vdoremi0600."I guess you really are an idiot, Karin. Trusting Fuuka, who talks about you behind your back over me, you're a massive idiot…!"
3507	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0561."…Wh… what do you intend to do… Doremi?"
3508	Doremi@r@vdoremi0601."Oh my. Don't stand out of your seat. Since you'll be @b.@<Condemned@> again very soon."
3509	Doremi@r@vdoremi0602."If you try to clumsily get out of that chair, won't you just get dragged back into it and get hurt badly…?"
3510	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0562."…Gh…"
3511	Doremi@r@vdoremi0603."Right. …Seems like both of you are totally dead…"
3512	Doremi@r@vdoremi0604."Not guilty."
3513	@rFuuka is made the @b.@<Condemned@> once again, and the reeling of the chain squeezing Karin and Mina's necks is stopped…
3514	Doremi@r@vdoremi0605."For Karin, the idiot who chose Fuuka over me, a barbecue in hell suits you nicely…"
3515	@rThe chain squeezing Karin's neck is removed, and Karin collapses and falls on the spot. Right afterwards, Mina collapses and falls as well.
3516	@rAt the same time, their hair and skin is burned, and a foul odor hangs over them…
3517	Doremi@r@vdoremi0606."Now, once again: not guilty."
3518	@rMina, now collapsed on the floor, is dragged across the burning hot mesh, into the torture chair.
3519	@rShe is already a lifeless corpse, but the mechanism in the torture chair catches her arms and legs regardless, binding them tightly in place with the restraints…
3520	Doremi@r@vdoremi0607."Well, Karin… I'll have you perform your final task as a @b.@<Judge@>…"
3521	Doremi@r@vdoremi0608."…Fuuka. You can stand up now. Or rather, get over here and help me. There's no time."
3522	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0563."Help you? After you were going to let me die…?!"
3523	Doremi@r@vdoremi0609."Don't hold it against me. Each of us only did what was best for our survival."
3524	Doremi@r@vdoremi0610."As a result… just like Karin and Mina hoped, it doesn't seem like we're letting you die after all, Fuuka."
3525	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0564.@z132."…HOW KIND OF YOU TO TRUST ME NOT TO BETRAY YOU! AFTER YOU SAID ALL THAT DISPARAGING SHIT ABOUT ME!"
3526	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0565.@z132."RIGHT NOW I FEEL JUST AS STRONGLY AS YOU, NO, EVEN MORE STRONGLY, THAT I CAN'T TRUST YOU, DOREMI!"
3527	Doremi@r@vdoremi0611."Just let it be water under the bridge. I'm sure you'd rather not decrease our mutual chances of surviving."
3528	Doremi@r@vdoremi0612."There's no guarantee that there won't be another death game after this one…!"
3529	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0566."…Kh…"
3530	@rFuuka glares at Doremi filled with hate, but she realizes the hand on the clock shows that there isn't even one minute left.
3531	@rThe pair of them drag Karin's body over to the torture chair Mina is secured into.
3532	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0567."…‘Only the hand of the other @b.@<Judge@> can operate the torture lever,’ or something along those lines…"
3533	Doremi@r@vdoremi0613."We'll bet on her not needing to be alive or do it voluntarily, as long as it's her hand."
3534	Doremi@r@vdoremi0613a."Guilty."
3535	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0568."Ready, set…!"
3536	@rKarin's hand is made to hold the torture lever and push it all the way down.
3537	@rWhen it does, the torture chair makes a metallic wrenching noise reminiscent of unpleasant memories at the dentist's office, and Mina's body that's sitting there is sent into convulsions.
3538	@rWhatever unimaginably disgusting mechanism is operating… she's probably, mercifully, already dead, or so Doremi reassures herself.
3539	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0569."…Didn't the collars make a noise just now?!"
3540	Doremi@r@vdoremi0614."I can get this collar off now…!"
3541	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0570."The elevator door is open…!! Hurry, get this collar — kh…!"
3542	@rAlthough the exit opens, everything starts being swallowed into the furnace of hell. Time is up.
3543	@rThe inferno, reaching all the way to the ceiling, erupts in sequence from the four corners, surrounding them…
3544	@rAt the same time the pair throws the abhorrent collars to the floor… the infernal maelstr@u246.m is already…
3545	Doremi@r@vdoremi0615."…Ha, hahahaha."
3546	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0571."It's so stupid. If the four of us were going to die anyway, I'd have wanted us to die as four good friends."
3547	Doremi@r@vdoremi0616."…It's fine like this! I mean, finally being able to get our feelings, that we've wanted to express for so long, out to each other was fun."
3548	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0572."You idiot. It wasn't fun at all. …Haha, hahahaha."
3549	Doremi@r@vdoremi0617."Ahahaha, ahahaha."

3557	Mina@r@vmina0540."…Look, Fuuka-chan. There's no time to lose!"
3558	Mina@r@vmina0541."So now we're gonna tightly wrap your chain around the hanging cage, right?"
3559	Karin@r@vkarin0594."Th-that's right…! There's hardly any time left!"
3560	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0574."There was one other thing I'd like to try, but… at this point, this is the only thing left to try…"
3561	@rFuuka coils up the chain connected to her own collar and entangles it with the bars of the cage the boy is in, tying it into knots.
3562	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0575."…Sorry, little boy. The cage might sway."
3563	Boy@r@vm_shou0024."………"
3564	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0576."…Even if this scheme of mine somehow succeeds… I won't be able to help this kid…"
3565	Mina@r@vmina0542."You are the other @b.@<Judge@>, right, Karin-chan? Be on standby under Fuuka-chan's chair."
3566	Mina@r@vmina0543."We can't waste any time. So when I make Fuuka-chan the @b.@<Condemned@> again, try pulling the torture lever right afterward."
3567	Karin@r@vkarin0595."G-got it…!"
3568	Mina@r@vmina0544."After that, Doremi-chan, you'll be the @b.@<Joker@> again for just a moment, but. I recommend not standing up from your seat."
3569	Mina@r@vmina0545."If you try to clumsily get out of your seat, you'll just be dragged back into it again and it will hurt, and you wouldn't like that, right?"
3570	Doremi@r@vdoremi0618."…Minaaa…!"
3571	Mina@r@vmina0546."Okay, I'm starting."
3572	Mina@r@vmina0547.——Not guilty.
3573	@rAt Mina's verdict, Fuuka is once again made the @b.@<Condemned@>.
3574	@rFuuka's torture chair reels in the chain on her collar with terrifying speed in order to restrain her once again.
3575	@rHowever, in the next instant, the chain violently pulls on the hanging cage… until the forces balance out.
3576	@rThe torture chair is just barely unable to pull in its chain, so Fuuka is unharmed.
3577	Karin@r@vkarin0596."Yay… it worked…!"
3578	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0577."Now I'm @b.@<Condemned@>, but I'm not in the torture chair…"
3579	Mina@r@vmina0548."Then, I'll make the verdict. Guilty."
3580	Karin@r@vkarin0597."Now… I just pull the torture lever…!!"
3581	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0578."Do it, Karin! …Karin!"
3582	Karin@r@vkarin0598."…U-hnng…!"
3583	Karin@r@vkarin0599."…It's no good…"
3584	Karin@r@vkarin0600."It's locked. It won't fucking budge…! Goddamnit!"
3585	Mina@r@vmina0549."I guess it's too bad. Okay, I'll change it again. Not guilty."
3586	@rAt this verdict, Doremi is once again made the @b.@<Condemned@>.
3587	@rThe chain pulling on Fuuka is slackened and loosens…
3588	Doremi@r@vdoremi0619."See? there's nothing we can do…! That was but a waste of effort!"
3589	Karin@r@vkarin0601."Uwaah?! What's this?! Th-the flames at our feet, b-became stronger!!"
3590	Mina@r@vmina0550."That's the result of Doremi-chan wasting time instead of cooperating with us."
3591	Doremi@r@vdoremi0620.@z150."HAHA, HA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!"
3592	Doremi@r@vdoremi0621."That's not it. This is the result you were hoping for, the result you deserved."
3593	Doremi@r@vdoremi0622."Mina, you've known right from the start that, in order to get out of here alive, there needs to be a sacrifice."
3594	Doremi@r@vdoremi0623."And given the choice between sacrificing either Fuuka or me, you've decided on me, who you've hated for a long time."
3595	Doremi@r@vdoremi0624."So when Fuuka blurted out a ridiculous suggestion to try, you jumped at the convenient chance…!"
3596	Doremi@r@vdoremi0625."No matter what fate we meet, it's been decided all along that I'd end up like this…!"
3597	Mina@r@vmina0551."Yep, you're right. Clap clap clap."
3598	Mina@r@vmina0552."Doremi-chan, your aim was to waste everyone's time and back us into a corner so we'd all agree with you to sacrifice Fuuka as the @b.@<Condemned@>."
3599	Mina@r@vmina0553."But, you see, Mina reaaaally loves Fuuka-chan. She'd absolutely never abandon her."
3600	Mina@r@vmina0554."Now that she was able to change it to Doremi-chan, who she really hates, she's happyy."
3601	Karin@r@vkarin0602."………"
3602	Karin@r@vkarin0603."…Is this place… Hell…"
3603	Doremi@r@vdoremi0626.@z132."HAHAHAHA, HA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!! THE REAL HELL IS JUST GETTING STARTED!"
3604	Doremi@r@vdoremi0627.@z144."ALL OF YOU DIE!! DIE, DIEeeE!! BURN TO DEATH WITH ME!! HAHAHA, A-HAHAHAHAHA!!"
3605	Mina@r@vmina0555."Guilty."
3606	@rAt Mina's guilty verdict, a small sound can be heard from the torture chair Doremi is bound to.
3607	@rIn all likelihood, an unlocking sound.
3608	@rThere's no doubt the torture chair has unlocked the torture lever, as if to sink its teeth ever more tightly into its prey…
3609	Mina@r@vmina0556."Karin-chan. Pull the torture lever."
3610	Karin@r@vkarin0604."…*Huff*… *huff*… *huff*"
3611	Mina@r@vmina0557."Are we all gonna burn to death together? That would be painful, getting burned to death."
3612	Karin@r@vkarin0605."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*, *huff*…!!"
3613	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0579."…u… a… u"
3614	Doremi@r@vdoremi0628."Fuuka the malicious one, who wants to stop it but can't say anything or she'll die herself!"
3615	Doremi@r@vdoremi0629."And Karin the weakling, who normally acts like such a hero of justice but is the one getting pushed around by Mina the most!"
3616	Doremi@r@vdoremi0630."Sound good? If you can sacrifice me, you should give it a try!"
3617	Doremi@r@vdoremi0631."If you can do it, I'll give you a reward…"
3618	Doremi@r@vdoremi0632."I'll let you hear my horrible death screams of agony… that won't ever leave your ears as they haunt you for the rest of your lives!!"

# 05_gameB前半04 (first half 04)
3619	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0581."…You're lying… Doremi…"
3620	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0582."…Doremi…"
3621	Doremi@r@vdoremi0635."………"
3622	Doremi@r@vdoremi0636."…Look, Mina. There's hardly any time left."
3623	Doremi@r@vdoremi0637."You too, Karin. After the @b.@<Joker@> Fuuka generously took your place."
3624	Karin@r@vkarin0607."…Ah… ahh."
3625	Karin@r@vkarin0608."Fuuka, I give you my sincere thanks…. I'll look for a way all of us can escape, alright-"
3626	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0583."………"
3627	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0584."…Do your utmost… to search, alright…?"
3628	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0585."And then when you don't find anything… to a satisfying degree…"
3629	Karin@r@vkarin0609."Where do we look?! Where do we look?! Uuuu!"
3630	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0586."…You all searched the places you've seen. Try searching the places you haven't thought of yet, like the torture chair."
3631	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0587."The mechanism in the torture chair must be the only way to get out of this room that the culprit set up."
3632	Karin@r@vkarin0610."Y-you're right…. It's worth searching…!"
3633	Mina@r@vmina0564."The cage that kid is in fell down from the ceiling…"
3634	Mina@r@vmina0565."Which means, in the ceiling, where the cage is hanging from, shouldn't there be a mechanism that allows things to get in and out…?"
3635	Doremi@r@vdoremi0638."That's not a bad place to start. But as long as we have these chains, we can't do anything."
3636	Doremi@r@vdoremi0639."Even if, say, the culprit decided to open the elevator door on a whim… we couldn't get in it as long as we can't do anything about these collars and chains."
3637	Mina@r@vmina0566."…But, just getting in it should be possible, right?"
3638	Mina@r@vmina0567."Like, didn't the culprit say so? ‘Everything in this room is made of an exceptionally heat resistant metal.’"
3639	Doremi@r@vdoremi0640."I see. I guess you mean we can temporarily evade the flames from this room inside the elevator."
3640	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0588."…And what will you do if the elevator decides to start moving on a whim?"
3641	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0589."As long as those chains are there, I don't think the door can be closed but… if, it moved, your throats would be crushed between the collars and the elevator…"
3642	Mina@r@vmina0568."Oh yeah… so there's no point…"
3643	Karin@r@vkarin0611."Ultimately, the whole problem is these chains!"
3644	Karin@r@vkarin0612."If we could do something about these damn things, they wouldn't even be able to drag us into those creepy fucking chaiirs!"
3645	Karin@r@vkarin0613."If there's some way to get out of here, we just might be able to fucking do something…!"
3646	@rKarin stomps on her chain hatefully.
3647	@rThen, she kicks the torture chair prepared for her, over and over again…
3648	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0590."Everyone… can we get to it…?"
3649	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0591."This should be an obvious conclusion… the culprit, who went so far to set up this death game, probably wouldn't give us any opening."
3650	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0592."It isn't just you, Karin… this can only be a ritual to make all of us accept our fates."
3651	Karin@r@vkarin0614."…Shit… shit…!"
3652	Doremi@r@vdoremi0641."Everyone knew, but we just didn't want to acknowledge it."
3653	Doremi@r@vdoremi0642."But… it's time to acknowledge it."
3654	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0593."The fact that… there is no other way to escape this room aside from the one given by the death game…"
3655	Mina@r@vmina0569."…No way…"
3656	Karin@r@vkarin0615."………"
3657	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0594."…Karin. Are you convinced now?"
3658	Karin@r@vkarin0616."………"
3659	Karin@r@vkarin0617."…Yes…"
3660	Karin@r@vkarin0618."Thank you for… giving me time, Fuuka…"
3661	Mina@r@vmina0570."…Karin-chan…"
3662	Karin@r@vkarin0619."Guess it can't be helped…. I'm @b.@<Condemned@>."
3663	Karin@r@vkarin0620."Fuuka gave me time to come to this conclusion myself. I've gotta return the favor…"
3664	Mina@r@vmina0571.@z172."NO!!"
3665	Mina@r@vmina0572.@z133."KARIN-CHAN CAN'T DIE, MINA DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT KARIN-CHAN!!"
3666	Karin@r@vkarin0621."M-Mina…"
3667	Mina@r@vmina0573."Mina always gets saved by Karin-chan! And with that, it's fun, and makes Mina happy!"
3668	Mina@r@vmina0574."So Mina never has to think much about it, and can have fun being bullied! Her failures make her happy!"
3669	Mina@r@vmina0575."Karin-chan will come to save Mina again, Karin-chan cares about Mina, she'll come to save her like she's a princess, it makes Mina so glad…!"
3670	Mina@r@vmina0576."But then, Mina thinks that must have caused trouble for Karin-chan-"
3671	Mina@r@vmina0577."Whenever Karin-chan saved Mina, it was like giving treats to a dog or a cat, Mina's one-sided self indulgence!"
3672	Mina@r@vmina0578."Karin-chan must think Mina is annoying, or a pain in the butt, she must really think so!"
3673	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0595."…Wh… what's this about…?"
3674	Mina@r@vmina0579."Doremi-chan vomited out everything in her heart! So, shouldn't Mina do that too?!"
3675	Doremi@r@vdoremi0643."…Yeah. Go ahead."
3676	Doremi@r@vdoremi0644.“We're in the depths of hell after all. The heart cannot tell lies in front of Lord Yama.” [Hindu/Buddhist god of death, like Hades]
3677	Mina@r@vmina0580."Yeah. So Mina will say it."
3678	Mina@r@vmina0581."Mina really loves Karin-chan! Thank you for everything!!"
3679	Mina@r@vmina0582."And… she's really sorry, she's sorry for all that happened before!!"
3680	Mina@r@vmina0583."Karin-chan is always saving Mina… but Mina has never once tried to save Karin-chan!"
3681	Karin@r@vkarin0622."…Mina…"
3682	Mina@r@vmina0584."So that's why, this time, Mina will rescue her! This time, it's Mina's turn to save Karin-chan!"
3683	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0596."………"
3684	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0597."…What… are you saying…?"
3685	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0598.@z132."DON'T SAY THINGS I DON'T FUCKING GET!! HURRY UP AND DECLARE ME NOT GUILTY, NOW!!!"
3686	Mina@r@vmina0585.——Guilty.
3687	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0599."………"
3688	Mina@r@vmina0586."………"
3689	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0600."…M…"
3690	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0601."M-M-M… M-M-M-M…"
3691	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0602.@z163."MINAAAAaAaaAaaaa, AAAaAAAAAAaAARGH!!!"
3692	Karin@r@vkarin0623."…M-Mina…! I feel glad-, I'm glad, but…"
3693	Karin@r@vkarin0624."This is a mistake! This is wrong, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it…!"
3694	Mina@r@vmina0587."What's wrong about it…?"
3695	Mina@r@vmina0588."After all. Isn't the @b.@<Condemned@> Fuuka-chan? It isn't Karin-chan, right…?"
3696	Karin@r@vkarin0625."That's right! But don't do it, don't use this kind of deception…!"
3697	Karin@r@vkarin0626."I was @b.@<Condemned@>…! I just had to prepare myself! That's all it was!"
3698	Karin@r@vkarin0627."Fuuka was only granting my wish to try my best…"
3699	Doremi@r@vdoremi0645."Fuuka isn't granting anything."
3700	Mina@r@vmina0589."That's right. …That verdict was just… Mina-chan's feelings of wanting to rescue Karin-chan from being @b.@<Condemned@>."
3701	Karin@r@vkarin0628."But that's no good, either…! This is wrong! I feel bad for Fuuka…!"
3702	Karin@r@vkarin0629."She certainly… had her cold moments at times! But that doesn't change anything now!"
3703	Karin@r@vkarin0630."She was the @b.@<Joker@>! She was in a position where she could become @b.@<Condemned@> at a moment's notice!"
3704	Karin@r@vkarin0631."But even then, there's no way around it! I can't condemn Fuuka! And it'd be the same if it were the other way around, I'm sure of it!"
3705	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0603."…Karin…"
3706	Karin@r@vkarin0632."Mina and Doremi all voiced their true feelings at each other, so… lemme say mine, too."
3707	Karin@r@vkarin0633."I love you, Fuuka…!"
3708	Karin@r@vkarin0634."Just like how Mina says she can't go to school without me, I can't go to school without you!"
3709	Doremi@r@vdoremi0646."…Do you not know? …Fuuka always—"
3710	Karin@r@vkarin0635.@z150."I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT!!"
3711	Karin@r@vkarin0636."Like, I can't read the room, and I forget my promises, and I can't keep my priorities straight."
3712	Karin@r@vkarin0637."I think I definitely caused trouble for a lot of people around me and ruined their mood."
3713	Karin@r@vkarin0638."So that's why… if Fuuka thought like that about me… I wouldn't be shocked by it, in fact, I couldn't even deny it."
3714	Karin@r@vkarin0639."It's only just, the most important, simple thing! Just like you said about me, Mina!"
3715	Karin@r@vkarin0640."You might think badly of me, Doremi. And you might think badly of me too, Mina. But I love Fuuka!"
3716	Karin@r@vkarin0641."I don't feel like going to school or facing a tomorrow without Fuuka, you see…!!"
3717	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0604."…Karin… are you… serious…?"
3718	Karin@r@vkarin0642."Yeah, dang right I'm serious. I mean, I've heard about everyone saying I'm a piece of shit, and even I got over that."
3719	Karin@r@vkarin0643."Mina. Make me @b.@<Condemned@> again."
3720	Mina@r@vmina0590."No way!"
3721	Karin@r@vkarin0644."If you won't make me the @b.@<Condemned@>… I'm not moving from this spot."
3722	@rKarin takes a seat… in her own torture chair.
3723	Karin@r@vkarin0645."I'm already prepared to die. If other people aside from me want to survive, that's now up to you, Mina and Doremi."
3724	Doremi@r@vdoremi0647."………"
3725	Karin@r@vkarin0646."Doremi. …If you pull Fuuka's torture lever… I'm taking you with me."
3726	Doremi@r@vdoremi0648."K… Karin…! Hnnng… gh-"
3727	Karin@r@vkarin0647."Looks like time's up pretty soon, eh?"
3728	Doremi@r@vdoremi0649."…Ugh…"
3729	Karin@r@vkarin0648."It's pretty funny. Now that I'm prepared to die, it feels like I'm just in a sauna. Hahahaha…"
3730	Doremi@r@vdoremi0650."…Mina. …Make Karin the @b.@<Condemned@>."
3731	Mina@r@vmina0591.@z138."NO WAY, ABSOLUTELY NOT!! JUST PULL FUUKA'S TORTURE LEVER ALREADY…!"
3732	Karin@r@vkarin0649."You already know that, if you pull that lever…"
3733	Doremi@r@vdoremi0651."Gh… ghh…"
3734	Karin@r@vkarin0650."After this, Doremi and Mina, start getting along with each other already."
3735	Karin@r@vkarin0651."…Who even called us that? Like we're really a group of four friends. Right, Fuuka?"
3736	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0605."…Karin…"
3737	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0606."………"
3738	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0607."In the end… you just couldn't find a way to escape… in the end, you made everyone die."
3739	Karin@r@vkarin0652."My bad, really."
3740	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0608."…But… you did rescue me."
3741	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0609."From the depths of this Hell, with only those words of yours."
3742	Karin@r@vkarin0653."I should be grateful too, to Mina. She made me happy with only those words of hers."
3743	@rMina and Doremi have started to scuffle with each other during this exchange.
3744	@rBut, pillars of fire are erupting out of the floor in sequence, surrounding the room.
3745	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0610."…Doremi."
3746	@rThese words don't reach Doremi's ears, whose continued screams and howls mix with angry shouts and agonizing death screams…
3747	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0611."I'm really sorry for making you think you were my vomit bag…"
3748	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0612."But, you know… there's one thing you can trust me on…"
3749	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0613."That in spite of that… I think of you as… my number one best friend…"
3750	@rAt last, the pillars of fire reach the ceiling and swallow all of the girls…

# 05_gameB前半05 (first half 05)
3751	Doremi@r@vdoremi0652."Cut it out already, Fuuka…!!"
3752	Doremi@r@vdoremi0653."What good is this doing?! We're wasting time!"
3753	Mina@r@vmina0592."…uu… T-that's right. Let's… stop this…"
3754	Doremi@r@vdoremi0654."Now isn't the time for this. Everyone, put your feelings aside!"
3755	Doremi@r@vdoremi0655."I trust Karin. …If we don't trust her, there's no way out of this!"
3756	Doremi@r@vdoremi0656."…I just have to make a verdict, right? Not guilty."
3757	@rAs soon as this verdict is made, the arm and leg restraints binding Karin are released.
3758	@rThen, as expected, Mina is bound to her own torture chair with the arm and leg restraints…
3759	@rKarin gets herself up, extending the loosened chain, and is now able to freely walk around the room.
3760	Karin@r@vkarin0654."…Phew…"
3761	Karin@r@vkarin0655."Thank you, Mina. …Just leave the rest to me!"
3762	Mina@r@vmina0593."Karin-chan, Mina begs you…!"
3763	@rKarin wipes the sweat off her hands on the hem of her skirt and grabs the thin pipe in the corner of the room.
3764	Karin@r@vkarin0656."Hng… hnnnnghhhhh…!"
3765	Karin@r@vkarin0657.@z150."UoRAAaAAAAAH…!!!"
3766	Mina@r@vmina0594."…Amazing…! She got it…!"
3767	Karin@r@vkarin0658."I feel pretty good about this. …I should be able to use this as a lever…"
3768	@rKarin then walks toward the elevator door, with the pipe she tore off in her hands.
3769	@rThen, skillfully pushing the end of the pipe into the gap in the doors, she exerts her strength…
3770	Karin@r@vkarin0659."Reaady, set… hnnnnnnng…!"
3771	Mina@r@vmina0595.@z150."YAY, IT OPENED, IT OPENED…!!"
3772	Doremi@r@vdoremi0657."The interior looks like a regular elevator…. Now, if we can do something about these collars… we can escape…"
3773	Karin@r@vkarin0660."I guess it's just the collars now. Doremi, let me take a closer look at yours."
3774	Doremi@r@vdoremi0658."…I'm counting on you…"
3775	Mina@r@vmina0596."The collar… can come off, right, it can come off, right…?"
3776	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0614."………"
3777	Karin@r@vkarin0661."…This is a tricky mechanism… ah, I see…"
3778	Doremi@r@vdoremi0659."What's it like…?"
3779	Karin@r@vkarin0662."No, I get it, probably. …Doremi, can you try declaring her guilty for now?"
3780	Doremi@r@vdoremi0660."Why?"
3781	Karin@r@vkarin0663."This mechanism probably… can't be released until a guilty verdict is made. If I could just get this part off, I could use force…"
3782	Doremi@r@vdoremi0661."Changing it back to not guilty afterwards… alright, I got it."
3783	Doremi@r@vdoremi0662."Guilty."
3784	@rSuddenly, accompanied by a terrible metallic sound… Doremi's neck is twisted and bent… and she goes limp and falls.
3785	@rThe hair of the collapsed Doremi scatters around and is burned by the fire, causing a foul odor to waft around…
3786	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0615."…Karin… Karin…!"
3787	Karin@r@vkarin0664."You see, like, only Doremi can declare people guilty or not guilty. …So now, I can't be made the @b.@<Condemned@> again."
3788	Mina@r@vmina0597."…Eh? …Eh? Wh-what's that mean…?!"
3789	Karin@r@vkarin0665."It all rested on whether she would say ‘guilty’ or not…"
3790	Karin@r@vkarin0666."But… to think it'd go so well, and she'd say it with such conviction… it's quite a relief… ha-hahahahahaha…"
3791	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0616."Look, see? …Didn't I tell you Karin was a liar…?"
3792	Mina@r@vmina0598."…No way… no way…"
3793	Karin@r@vkarin0667."You guys… are always saying how I don't study, how my grades are so bad, and all that crap,"
3794	Karin@r@vkarin0668.@z127."WELL WHO'S THE STUPID ONE HERE NOWWWW?! WHO'S THE FUCKING IDIOT NOWWWW?!"
3795	Karin@r@vkarin0669.@z132."NO SHIT WE CAN'T BREAK THESE COLLARS, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?! NOTHING WE CAN THINK OF WILL ACTUALLY WORK!!"
3796	Karin@r@vkarin0670.@z127."I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D ACTUALLY BUY MY STUPID BULLSHIT ABOUT BREAKING THEM, HYA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!"
3797	Mina@r@vmina0599."…Then, then, what does Karin-chan intend to do about her own collar…"
3798	Karin@r@vkarin0671.@z138."IT'S SIMPLE, YOU IIiIIIiIiDIOT!!! DIDN'T DOREMI SAY YOU'RE GUILTY?!"
3799	Karin@r@vkarin0672.@z116."NOW WE CAN USE THE TORTURE LEVER! ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR THE @b.@<JUDGE@>, FUUKA, TO PULL IT AND WE'LL BE RELEAASED!!"
3800	Mina@r@vmina0600."N… no way… no wayyy…!!"
3801	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0617.@z145."YOU THINK… I'D PULL THAT LEVER AND DO SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE TO MINA-CHAN…?!"
3802	Karin@r@vkarin0673."………"
3803	Karin@r@vkarin0674."I'm begging you, Fuuka. Just… trust me…"
3804	Karin@r@vkarin0675."There's nothing else I could do…. I mean, if it kept going like that, everyone would simply have died…"
3805	Karin@r@vkarin0676."You're the one I love the most, Fuuka. …This is the only way the both of us can get out of here…!"
3806	Mina@r@vmina0601."…Then… wh-what about Mina…?"
3807	Karin@r@vkarin0677.@z150."YOU DON'T EVEN DESERVE TO FUCKING LIVE!!!"
3808	Karin@r@vkarin0678.@z111."YOU'RE JUST THE PET EVERYONE CODDLES! YOU'RE JUST AN ANIMAL, YOU CUNT!! YOU DON'T FUCKING DESERVE TO LIVE!!"
3809	Mina@r@vmina0602."…N… no… way…"
3810	@rTo be told something like this by Karin, with whom she believed she was really close…
3811	@rMina's ears and mind reject this interpretation…
3812	@rKarin, after her sudden outburst, once again returns to her sad, pathetic, pleading expression…
3813	Karin@r@vkarin0679."…Fuuka. …Won't you survive with me…?"
3814	Karin@r@vkarin0680."Fuuka, you're… the one I love most, you know…?"
3815	Karin@r@vkarin0681."So I'm begging you. …Won't you just… pull the lever…?"
3816	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0618."…Once I pull it, you'll just do the same thing to me. …As soon as I've served my purpose, you'll kill me as well, won't you…?"
3817	Karin@r@vkarin0682."You're the one person I'd never do anything like that to, no matter what…!"
3818	Karin@r@vkarin0683."Since… for a long time now… ever since I met you, I've always loved you the most, more than anyone else…"
3819	Karin@r@vkarin0684."…So just… trust me…"
3820	Karin@r@vkarin0685."I'd never do anything violent to you no matter what… I promise I won't…"
3821	Karin@r@vkarin0686."*sob*… *sob*…"
3822	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0619."………"
3823	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0620."…ho…"
3824	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0621.@z150."HOW COULD I EVER… BELIEVE IN A PROMISE YOU MAKE!!"
3825	Karin@r@vkarin0687."…Hic… hic… I guess so…"
3826	Karin@r@vkarin0688."I guess so… I guess so, I guess so…?"
3827	Karin@r@vkarin0689.@z150."ALRIIGHT THEN, I GUESS I HAVE TO FUCKING KILL YOU AFTER AAALL, HUHHHhHH?!"
3828	@rKarin, with an expression like a demon rising to her face, swings the pipe around and violently smashes it on the mesh floor.
3829	@rIf Hell exists, if demons exist… then this scene is what it looks like.
3830	Karin@r@vkarin0690."Heyyy, Fuukaaaa. …A lot may have happened between us but, can you just let it go?"
3831	Karin@r@vkarin0691."I know you used to hate me a lot but still… even so, even now, I still think of you as my best friend."
3832	Karin@r@vkarin0692."You, the one who told me she hated my guts, are gonna die here today."
3833	Karin@r@vkarin0693."And me, the one you resent so much, will die here too. How 'bout it? How 'bout we make up with each other in the next life?"
3834	Karin@r@vkarin0694."How 'bout we let everything up until today be water under the bridge… and after today, we become true best friends in the next life…?"
3835	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0622."………"
3836	Karin@r@vkarin0695."I've always thought of you as my best friend, right from the start."
3837	Karin@r@vkarin0696."Fuuka. If you let it all be water under the bridge, we can just go back to being real best friends who get along, can we…?"
3838	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0623."I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass…"
3839	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0624."After all, you don't understand anyone else's heart! And you're the worst type of girl, the type that can't even keep her promises!"
3840	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0625."Just go back to being best friends, with a girl like that…?"
3841	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0626.@z150."WHO WOULD TRUST YOU, YOU BIG FAT LIAR!!! TRY SAYING THAT TO DOREMI!!"
3842	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0627."After what's happened, you want it all to be water under the bridge so we can go back to being best friends…?"
3843	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0628.@z132."I GUESS YOU'RE AN IDIOT AFTER ALL, KARIN!! WHO WOULD EVER MAKE UP WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU!!"
3844	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0629.@z132."AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID, IT'D BE A RELIEF FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO BURN TO DEATH!!!"
3845	Karin@r@vkarin0697."…*Huff*. …Good grief…"
3846	Karin@r@vkarin0698."Whatever. I won't ask anything from you."
3847	Karin@r@vkarin0699."‘The torture lever can only be pulled by the hand of the @b.@<Judge@> who didn't make the verdict’. …He said something like that, right?"
3848	Karin@r@vkarin0700."…I thought it was a strange way of putting it. Like, that he'd specifically mention your hand."
3849	Karin@r@vkarin0701."In other words… as long as I have Fuuka's hand, it doesn't matter if Fuuka herself is alive or not."
3850	Mina@r@vmina0603."Wh-what…?! The flames are, getting stronger…!!"
3851	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0630."There's not even two minutes left…"
3852	Karin@r@vkarin0702."Right, let's get right to it…"
3853	@rKarin quickly approaches Fuuka.
3854	@rFuuka retreats back behind the chair Mina is sitting in.
3855	Karin@r@vkarin0703.@z150."C'MON, C'MON, C'MON…!! TIME TO DIE, FUUKAaAAAaAA!!!"

# 05_gameB前半06 (first half 06)
3856	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0640."…Sorry, Karin."
3857	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0641."I didn't mean to go that far but… I ended up saying too much."
3858	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0642."It's just, if I hadn't said it at that point, I would've had to stay quiet until I died, you know?"
3859	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0643."So I apologize… only for saying it at that moment."
3860	Karin@r@vkarin0706."………"
3861	Karin@r@vkarin0707."…N… no…"
3862	Karin@r@vkarin0708."I'm grateful… for telling me this…"
3863	Karin@r@vkarin0709."…And…"
3864	Karin@r@vkarin0710."Sorry… for not remembering very well…"
3865	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0644."If you apologize to me for something you can't remember, it doesn't exactly ring true, you know."
3866	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0645."So that's why, I realize it was wrong of me to say that now. So I apologize just for that, I suppose."
3867	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0646."But, I still won't forgive you."
3868	Karin@r@vkarin0711."…Y… yeah…"
3869	Doremi@r@vdoremi0663."Drop it already, Fuuka…"
3870	Mina@r@vmina0609."Yeah! This conversation really wasn't needed right now at all!!"
3871	Mina@r@vmina0610."Look at the clock! No, we can tell without looking, right?! There was never any time for this from the start!"
3872	Mina@r@vmina0611.@z150."FUUKA-CHAN IS AN IDIOT! STUPID STUPID IDIOT!!"
3873	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0647."…If there were any time left, what do you say you could have done…?"
3874	Mina@r@vmina0612."Eh?"
3875	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0648."Mina-chan, it's just like how you can watch TV while doing homework, I can vomit out my emotions while thinking a lot of things over."
3876	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0649."And as a result. I came to a very, very obvious answer."
3877	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0650."That there is no way whatsoever to escape from this room apart from the one the culprit intended."
3878	Doremi@r@vdoremi0664."…E-even so, we still have to think of something, don't we?"
3879	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0651."Yeah. So I thought it over. For a way we can all escape from here unscathed."
3880	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0652."And the conclusion I reached is that it's impossible."
3881	Mina@r@vmina0613."How can it be impossible!"
3882	Doremi@r@vdoremi0665."…Well, indeed… maybe we didn't even need to think about that…"
3883	Doremi@r@vdoremi0666."Even if… an escape exit were opened right in front of us…"
3884	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0653."As long as we can't do anything about these collars and chains, there's nothing we can do."
3885	Mina@r@vmina0614."Then, if everyone can think of a way to do something about these collars…!"
3886	Doremi@r@vdoremi0667."…Earlier, we all fiddled with our own collars."
3887	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0654."But we couldn't get them off, and it didn't even seem like they could come off."
3888	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0655."…It's obvious. These collars are the cornerstone of this death game."
3889	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0656."They're the most important mechanism forcing us into this death game… and there's nothing we can do about them with only a few minutes to spare."
3890	Mina@r@vmina0615."…But… but…"
3891	Mina@r@vmina0616."………"
3892	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0657."So that's why… even at a time like this, I vomited out everything that was in my heart."
3893	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0658."Escaping from this room is impossible."
3894	Doremi@r@vdoremi0668."…The only way… is to do what the culprit says."
3895	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0659."As long as we don't choose who to offer as a sacrifice, between the @b.@<Condemned@> and the @b.@<Joker@>, we can't survive."
3896	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0660."But. …Can we do it? Something like that."
3897	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0661."Do you think choosing, between Karin and Doremi, who we're going to let die, is something we can do?!"
3898	Mina@r@vmina0617."…*sob*…"
3899	Doremi@r@vdoremi0669."I don't want to die either."
3900	Doremi@r@vdoremi0670."However, what I'm saying is… if we sacrifice Karin and survive… what kind of future do you think we'll have?"
3901	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0662."I said I really hate Karin but, Mina, you feel differently, right?"
3902	Mina@r@vmina0618."K-Karin-chan is Mina's precious, precious number one friend!"
3903	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0663."But to me, Doremi is my precious, precious best friend."
3904	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0664."…See?"
3905	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0665."There exists no sacrifice that we can all civilly agree on."
3906	Doremi@r@vdoremi0671."If the two @b.@<Judges@> don't agree on a sacrifice… the torture lever can't be used to execute her."
3907	@rIt's not impossible for the @b.@<Judge@> who makes the guilty verdict, and the @b.@<Judge@> who operates the torture lever, to both boycott one another.
3908	@rIf even one of the two judges is dissatisfied with the chosen sacrifice, it's possible for her to veto it…
3909	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0666."That's right. Karin or Doremi. Regardless of who is chosen as the sacrifice… there's no way Mina-chan and I can agree on the answer."
3910	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0667."We're in a stalemate. It's been one from the beginning."
3911	Karin@r@vkarin0712."It's fine. …Go ahead and kill me."
3912	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0668."………"
3913	Mina@r@vmina0619."K-Karin-chan…"
3914	Mina@r@vmina0620."Don't say… things like that…!!"
3915	Karin@r@vkarin0713."Right now, it's exactly like Fuuka said. The only way anyone's getting out of here alive… is by sacrificing someone."
3916	Karin@r@vkarin0714."Fuuka… the @b.@<Judges@> might say they can't agree on a sacrifice, but,"
3917	Karin@r@vkarin0715."In that case, you can nominate me."
3918	Karin@r@vkarin0716."If I'm to get sacrified, I'll offer myself. Everyone, once you've survived, don't agonize over any of this."
3919	Doremi@r@vdoremi0672."…Is that okay with you? Really…?"
3920	Karin@r@vkarin0717."Yeah. …Since the world I want to return to alive… is gone."
3921	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0669."………"
3922	Karin@r@vkarin0718."…I'd just… keep crying…"
3923	Karin@r@vkarin0719."To be despised so much… by Fuuka, who I love so much…"
3924	Karin@r@vkarin0720."But, hey… you still pushed that aside and got along with me so well…"
3925	Karin@r@vkarin0721."And then, even at a time like this… you were honest to me about it… I'm… grateful… for that…"
3926	Karin@r@vkarin0722."So thank you… Fuuka."
3927	Karin@r@vkarin0723."Thank you… for being so friendly with me… even though I made you suffer so much…"
3928	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0670."………"
3929	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0671."…You don't have to thank me that much."
3930	Mina@r@vmina0621.@z150."NO, I CAN'T HAVE SCHOOL WITHOUT KARIN-CHAN, ABSOLUTELY NOOT!!"
3931	Karin@r@vkarin0724."Thank you. …Even just those words make me glad…"
3932	Mina@r@vmina0622."Karin-chan, Karin-chan… uwaaaaaaaaah…!"
3933	Doremi@r@vdoremi0673."…Mina. …It's not like it's decided for certain yet that Karin will die."
3934	Mina@r@vmina0623."Eh?! There's a way to save Karin-chan?!"
3935	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0672."…Is there?"
3936	Doremi@r@vdoremi0674."…That might have to depend on Karin…"
3937	Mina@r@vmina0624.@z150."TELL US!!"
3938	Doremi@r@vdoremi0675."From what the culprit said, it sounded like torture would be imposed on the @b.@<Condemned@>…"
3939	Doremi@r@vdoremi0676."If his aim were to kill her, he should have called it execution or the death penalty, or something like that…"
3940	Mina@r@vmina0625."Then, even if she gets tortured, Karin-chan won't die…?!"
3941	Doremi@r@vdoremi0677."It means she won't necessarily be tortured all the way to death."
3942	Karin@r@vkarin0725."…Indeed. …If he intended to kill her, he probably would've called it execution."
3943	Karin@r@vkarin0726."That lifts my spirits a little…. In other words… I can endure it…?"
3944	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0673."What about the @b.@<Condemned@>'s collar…?"
3945	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0674."When the torture lever is pulled, the other three besides the @b.@<Condemned@> can take their collars off. But the @b.@<Condemned@>'s collar can't come off."
3946	Mina@r@vmina0626."So then, even if she endures the torture, in the end she'll just burn to death?!"
3947	Karin@r@vkarin0727."Wh-what's with that, is it pointless after all…"
3948	Doremi@r@vdoremi0678."No… if you can somehow get through the torture… there's still a chance to get the collar off."
3949	Karin@r@vkarin0728."How?"
3950	Doremi@r@vdoremi0679."First, Karin, you endure the torture."
3951	Doremi@r@vdoremi0680."After that, the three of us apart from you get our collars off."
3952	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0675."…Aah, I see. So that's when we switch."
3953	Mina@r@vmina0627."That's it! After the collars come off, the @b.@<Joker@> is made the @b.@<Condemned@>, but then it becomes meaningless!"
3954	Karin@r@vkarin0729."…Gotcha. If I can just endure the torture… everyone can get their collars off, I guess…"
3955	Karin@r@vkarin0730."…Alright, I'm ready…"
3956	Karin@r@vkarin0731."Mina, I'll leave the verdict to you. …Fuuka, you take the lever."
3957	Mina@r@vmina0628."O-okay. …Guilty."
3958	@rSome kind of mechanical sound can be heard from the mechanism in the torture chair Karin is sitting in.
3959	@r…It's the sound of Karin's torture lever becoming operational.
3960	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0676."…Alright, ready? I'm going to pull the lever…"
3961	Karin@r@vkarin0732."Fuuka… again, I apologize."
3962	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0677."………"
3963	Karin@r@vkarin0733."I don't know what kind of torture this will be. Like, I don't even know if I'll survive it…"
3964	Karin@r@vkarin0734."But if I do endure it and survive,"
3965	Karin@r@vkarin0735."Forgive me for the things I did to hurt you. Even the things I can't remember… just forget about them for me."
3966	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0678."………"
3967	Karin@r@vkarin0736."I'll leave it to you…"
3968	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0679."………"
3969	Mina@r@vmina0629."Would Fuuka-chan please listen…!"
3970	Doremi@r@vdoremi0681."I feel the same. Let this serve as purification, a chance to forget about the past…!"
3971	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0680."………"
3972	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0681."…Must you gang up on me about this?"
3973	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0682."I got it, Karin. …If you get out of here alive, I'll let it all be water under the bridge and make up with you."
3974	Karin@r@vkarin0737."…Fuuka… thank you…!"
3975	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0683."…Alright,"
3976	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0684."…Here I go."
3977	Mina@r@vmina0630."Karin-chan, hang in there! Mina is here with Karin-chan…!!"
3978	Karin@r@vkarin0738."…Th-thank you! I'll… survive this no matter what, dammit…"
3979	Doremi@r@vdoremi0682."Mina. I understand your feelings, wanting to hold her hand, but it's dangerous…"
3980	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0685."That's right. What will you do if there turns out to be an electric current? …Get back."
3981	Karin@r@vkarin0739."Thanks a bunch, Mina. …It'll be alright."
3982	Karin@r@vkarin0740."…Fuuka. I'll leave it to you…"
3983	@rFuuka pulls the torture lever, and… a harsh mechanical sound rings out from the torture chair Karin is sitting in…
3984	@r…Karin endures it with a pained laugh while pushing aside her terror.
3985	@rThe next instant, that expression… is shattered.
3986	Karin@r@vkarin0741."eeeeeeeegheeeeeeeeeeeeeee—?!?!"
3987	Karin@r@vkarin0742.@z138."KHEEEEEeEEEEEEeEEE……—, NGHAAAaOOoOOAAAAAH-!!!"
3988	Mina@r@vmina0631."K-Karin-chan, hang in there!!"
3989	@rMina's voice doesn't reach her. The whites of Karin's eyes show as she screams up at the ceiling, continually convulsing…
3990	Doremi@r@vdoremi0683."Wh-what in the world… is happening to her…?!"
3991	Doremi@r@vdoremi0684."I can't tell what's happening from this point of view, I don't get it at all…"
3992	Mina@r@vmina0632."Still?! Mina and her friends' collars still can't be taken off?!"
3993	Doremi@r@vdoremi0685."I think, probably, these screws at the base of our necks can turn to release it, but…"
3994	Mina@r@vmina0633."How long does the torture go on for?! It's still not over?!"
3995	@rKarin's screaming doesn't stop. She violently writhes in agony while something that isn't quite saliva or foam overflows from her mouth…….
3996	@rHer consciousness is fading, but… even still, Karin believes.
3997	@rThat if she can get through this… she can be reborn.
3998	@rThat she can be forgiven by Fuuka. She believes that she can return to the original world where everyone got along.
3999	@rAnd so… in this agony of Hell where it feels like her guts are being ripped out from even just the pain, she clings to her last bit of sanity…
4000	@rIf I endure this, I can be forgiven by Fuuka…. If I endure this, I can be forgiven by Fuuka…
4001	@rSorry, Fuuka, I really love you, so that's why I want to go back to us being best friends like we used to be…!
4002	@rIf I endure this, I'll be reborn, won't I? If I endure this, you'll forgive me and let it all be water under the bridge, won't you?
4003	@rIf I endure this, if I endure thish, kbhhgh… khh, ggh…
4004	@rGgh, gh… goddammit, endure, endure…. Fuuka… making up with me…. Fuuka, I love you, we'll always be together, having fun, getting along…
4005	@rFuuka, are you watching? Can you look at me? I'm doing my best because I want you to forgive me…
4006	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0686.——Now die. Hurry up.
4007	Karin@r@vkarin0743."…Eh?"
4008	@r——You want to apologize for your own crimes that badly?
4009	@rFine. Apologize and I'll forgive you. It can be water under the bridge. I'll make up with you.
4010	@rBut, you see?
4011	@rThe person you need to apologize to isn't here. Go to the place where that person is, and then apologize.
4012	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0687."In that world."

4014	Mina@r@vmina0634."When does the torture end?! Is it still not over?!"
4015	Doremi@r@vdoremi0686."I-I don't know either! All we can do is pray…!"
4016	Mina@r@vmina0635."Karin-chan, hold on!! Mina is begging, stay stroooong!!"
4017	Doremi@r@vdoremi0687."Hurry up and end, please end already…! How long… how long does this go on for…!!"
4018	@r…You're all idioots.
4019	@rIt's indefinite. This torture will go on indefinitely.
4020	Karin@r@vkarin0745.@z138."………-, —……, GHE-…… eeEEee………-, ……—……——……"
4021	Mina@r@vmina0636.@z127."KARIN-CHAN, HANG ON!! HANG OoOOoN!! HURRY UP AND BE OVER, BE OVEEEeEeER!!"
4022	@r——When the lever is pulled down, the torture is started.
4023	@r——When the lever is pulled all the way down, the collars are released.
4024	@rThat's what the culprit said. Does everybody remember…?
4025	@rThe @b.@<Judge@> who can pull the torture lever has just one secret privilege.
4026	@rThat is… deciding whether or not to pull the torture lever all the way down. …With this,
4027	@rShe can make the torture either be finite, or be eternal…
4028	Karin@r@vkarin0746."……………-, —, …………——, …………-,"
4029	Mina@r@vmina0637.@z150."KARIN-CHAN!! KARIN-CHAAaAN!! UWAaAAaaaAH!!"
4030	Doremi@r@vdoremi0688."Oh my… god…. …This is… just an execution, isn't it…"
4031	@rNo voice can be heard coming from Karin's mouth anymore.
4032	@rDrool, foam, and dark red, viscous blood gurgles and overflows out of her…
4033	@rShe isn't convulsing anymore. …However, the light hasn't returned to her eyes, with their whites still showing.

4047	Karin@r@vkarin0749."I'm just telling you that you can do it, since you're gonna sacrifice yourself in order to rescue us."
4048	Mina@r@vmina0646."It's fine for you! Since you haaate me so much, it's no problem for you, yours was rotten all along!!"
4049	Mina@r@vmina0647."I'm asking about Doremi and Fuuka!!!"
4050	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0693."…Me?"
4051	Mina@r@vmina0648."After all, since when did you become so close with Karin?!"
4052	Mina@r@vmina0649."You're always calling her a liar behind her back, aren't you?!?!"
4053	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0694."………"
4054	Karin@r@vkarin0750."Huhh? As if Fuuka would ever say something like that about me. She and I are best friends, y'know?"
4055	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0695."Yeah, that's right. Hasn't Karin always been my best friend?"
4056	Mina@r@vmina0650."Heh. All this time, whenever Karin-chan would say something, you'd be behind her back, like,"
4057	Mina@r@vmina0651."‘I can't trust Karin.’ ‘She often spews lies.’ and stuff like that. Some best friend you are."
4058	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0696."What are you talking about?"
4059	Mina@r@vmina0652."You said it, I heard it. And it wasn't just once or twiiiice."
4060	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0697."Can you stop with this nonsense?"
4061	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0698."Karin, don't listen to her. It's just the panic getting to her head."
4062	Mina@r@vmina0653."Karin-chan, don't you remember? That time at the beginning of middle school, when we all went to hang out at Fuuka-chan's house—"
4063	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0699.@z150."SHUT THE FUCK UP MINA!!!"
4064	Mina@r@vmina0654."Aaa-haa!! ‘Shut the fuck up Mina,’ she said! For you, the honor student Fuuka, to say such filthy words, it's ultra rare! Hee-ha-ha-haa!"
4065	Karin@r@vkarin0751."………"
4066	Karin@r@vkarin0752."…Fuuka. About that day… I heard about it, right?"
4067	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0700."What about it? I have no idea what she's talking about."
4068	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0701."Right, Doremi? Surely you have no idea what she's talking about either."
4069	Doremi@r@vdoremi0691."…Nope. Whatever she's talking about, I have no idea."
4070	Mina@r@vmina0655."But, Doremi-chan, haven't you been pretending to be friends with Fuuka-chan all this time?"
4071	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0702."Huhh? Mina-chan, what are you going on about?"
4072	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0703."This is a waste of time. Doremi, just get it over with and pull Mina's torture lever."
4073	Mina@r@vmina0656."Hoooh. Even at a time like this, Princess Fuuka-chan is still acting like she's Doremi-chan's master, isn't she?"
4074	Mina@r@vmina0657."Oh my, didn't your lady order you to pull the torture lever? Say, ‘Certainly, Milady,’ and don't forget to kneel."
4075	Doremi@r@vdoremi0692."…Be quiet, shut up."
4076	Mina@r@vmina0658."Are you still the princess's vomit bag…? ‘As long as Fuuka can smile’…"
4077	Mina@r@vmina0659."Wouldn't it just be so chivalrous if you said that?! Doremi-chan, more like @bslave.@<Dorei@>-chan! Hyahahahahahaha!!"
4078	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0704."………"

4080	Doremi@r@vdoremi0693."………"
4081	Mina@r@vmina0660."Fuuka-chan, you always thought Doremi-chan was your best friend, am I right?"
4082	Mina@r@vmina0661."But tooooo baaaaad! Seems like it's not the case for her!!"
4083	Mina@r@vmina0662."Too bad for you too, Karin-chaan! And to think, all this time you really thought Fuuka-chan was your bestie!!"
4084	Mina@r@vmina0663."And that's just one of many episodes of things you thought were true. There are a whole bunch more, you know?"
4085	Mina@r@vmina0664."You wanna hear about them all? You might think of Mina as a dummy but actually, her memory is rather decent, y'know? Ahahahahahahahahaha!!"
4086	Mina@r@vmina0665."Of course, it's too bad for me too. Since I had no idea my dearly beloved Karin-chan resented me so much."
4087	Mina@r@vmina0666."Oh, that's right. Doremi-chan. While we're at it, there's something I wanted to mention. Doremi-chan and I have always totally been best friends, right?"
4088	Mina@r@vmina0667."Now you're abandoning me because you don't want to die, and you're all chanting together ‘you can do it, you can do it.’"
4089	Mina@r@vmina0668."But in reality you still see me as your best friend, and you're now feeling remorseful, right…?"
4090	Doremi@r@vdoremi0694."…I… I…"
4091	Doremi@r@vdoremi0695."…Ugh… A-apologies, Mina…. It's just… I don't want to d-die…"
4092	Mina@r@vmina0669."Yeah, that's fine, it is what it is. No one wants to die."
4093	Mina@r@vmina0670."Even I, if I were in your shoes, would probably be chanting ‘you can do it, you can do it’ at you, y'know? So we're pretty much even."
4094	Mina@r@vmina0671."But hey, listen. It's the same for you, Doremi-chan."
4095	Mina@r@vmina0672."Karin-chan, Fuuka-chan, and even me, believed in our friendships, but the truth was that they were one-sided."
4096	Mina@r@vmina0673."So, wouldn't you say it's the same for you, Doremi-chan?"
4097	Doremi@r@vdoremi0696."Wh-who are you saying hates me…"
4098	Mina@r@vmina0674."I'll tell you… who that person is. …Um, you see…"
4099	Mina@r@vmina0675."It's me, meeee, Yuasa Mina!!! The person I've always hated the most, more than anyone else in the world, ever since elementary school, is you, Hanabusa Doremi!!! You bitch!!!"
4100	Mina@r@vmina0676."What, why do you look so shocked all of a sudden?! Ah-hahaha, you really can't think of any reason I'd resent you, hmm?!"
4101	Mina@r@vmina0677."Well I ain't telling!!! Just live the rest of your life with those incomprehensible half-baked feelings for all I care!!"
4102	Doremi@r@vdoremi0697."…*sob*…"
4103	Mina@r@vmina0678.@z132."AH-HAHAHAHA, AHAHAHAHAHAHA! ISN'T IT HILARIOUS, I COULD JUST DIE OF LAUGHTEeR!"
4104	Mina@r@vmina0679."WEREN'T WE SUPPOOSED TO BE A GROUP OF FOUR GOOD FRIENDS? WHAT, KIND OF, FOUR GOOD FRIENDS, PHHH, IT'S SUCH A LAUGH, HEEHEE, AHEEHEE!!"
4105	Mina@r@vmina0680."We don't even get along at all… but the three of you started chanting ‘you can do it, you can do it’ together as if you were… it's such a laugh, it's such a laugh! Hee-heeheeheeheeheeheehee!!!"
4106	@rMina's voice is breaking down into laughter… and she cackles for some time. Her voice continues to reverberate around the small room…
4107	Mina@r@vmina0681."The flames at our feet sure seem to be getting stronger, hmm?"
4108	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0706."………"
4109	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0707."…Doremi. Pull Mina's torture lever."

4113	Doremi@r@vdoremi0700."Don't… order me around…! I'm… not… your house servant! I'm not your vomit bag…!"
4114	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0709."D-Doremi…?! What are you saying?! There's no way I'd ever think of you like—"
4115	Doremi@r@vdoremi0701.@z132."I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK! HOW ABOUT GIVING SOME THOUGHT TO HOW I FEEL, FOR ONCE!!"
4116	Doremi@r@vdoremi0702."Don't order me around, got it?! I'm a @b.@<Judge@>! And you're the @b.@<Joker@>, are you not?!"
4117	Doremi@r@vdoremi0703."You have no right to order me around! It's not like there's any absolute guarantee for your own safety, don't forget that!"
4118	Doremi@r@vdoremi0704."Maybe Mina started to resent me at some point, but I'm thinking of apologizing and making it up to her!"
4119	Doremi@r@vdoremi0705.@z132."BUT EVEN IF YOU APOLOGIZE, I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!! I'VE ALWAYS, ABSOLUTELY HATED YOUR GUTS!!"
4120	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0710."D-Doremi…! N… no way…!"
4121	Doremi@r@vdoremi0706."We all agreed to sacrifice Mina so we could survive but… if I can say how I really feel, my preference would be to make you the @b.@<Condemned@>, Fuuka!"
4122	Karin@r@vkarin0753."C-cut it out!! Not Fuuka! Fuuka's my best friend!!"
4123	Mina@r@vmina0682."But Fuuka-chan doesn't think of you that way at all, does she? About Karin-chan the liar."
4124	Karin@r@vkarin0754.@z127."STOP IT, STOP FUCKING WITH US!! THOSE ARE ALL YOUR LIES!! YOU'RE LYING ABOUT FUUKA HATING ME!!"
4125	Mina@r@vmina0683."Yeah. …I also had hopes you hating me was a lie."
4126	Mina@r@vmina0684."But in the end… it was all for nothing. Crushed and shattered."
4127	Mina@r@vmina0685."There's no going back. …Even if we try to pick up the fragments, we'll only get hurt again."
4128	Mina@r@vmina0686."So instead… I'll stomp and stomp on those fragments, grind them to bits."
4129	Mina@r@vmina0687."If I do that, they'll become like shiny stardust. …Maybe they'll even become one, you know?"
4130	Karin@r@vkarin0755a."Guilty!"
4131	Doremi@r@vdoremi0707.@z150."STOP RIGHT NOW, KARIN!! I WON'T KILL MINA! I WON'T LET YOU KILL HER!!"
4132	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0711.@z150."DOREMI!! DON'T LOSE YOUR MIND!! PULL MINA'S TORTURE LEVER…!!"
4133	Mina@r@vmina0688."Doremi-chan, I love you lots! I'll forgive you so… fight for me."
4134	Karin@r@vkarin0756.@z132."DON'T FUCKING LISTEN TO HER!! DIDN'T WE ALREADY DECIDE TO LET MINA DIE?! WE CAN'T JUST CHANGE OUR MIND!!"
4135	Doremi@r@vdoremi0708.@z150."I WON'T LET HER DIE, MINA SAID SHE FORGIVES ME!! I WON'T LET HER DIE!!"
4136	@rHee-hahahahahahahahahahahaha…!! You're funny. And cute, Doremi-chan.
4137	@rBut, you're an idiot. Because I'll never, ever, absolutely never, forgive someone like you.
4138	@rAnd, I loved you so much, Karin-chan, the one who pushed the plan to sacrifice me.
4139	@rI understand you'll never forgive me no matter what. …But still, I want us to make up.
4140	@rSo that's why.
4141	@rWe'll be thoroughly stomped and smashed into a fine powder… and become one, mixed into a shining sea of stars.
4142	@rYou know? It's for certain. That's how this messed up group of four good friends will make up.
4143	@rThose three are insulting each other and getting into a scuffle.
4144	@rA scuffle that nothing will come out of. It's a dance of moths flocking to a candle's flame.
4145	@rAnd now, pillars of flame are bursting through the mesh floor, surrounding us in sequence.
4146	@r…Now, we'll make up, completely.
4147	Mina@r@vmina0689."…Karin-chan. We can start getting along again, can we?"

4149	Doremi@r@vdoremi0709."How much time is left?! This is bad, there's hardly any!!"
4150	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0712."Not guilty."
4151	@rFuuka makes this verdict… as if it were a matter of fact, like a mindless agreement in a conversation.
4152	@rIn the next instant, Karin is pulled along by the chain on her collar with terrifying force.
4153	@rHer body is dragged over into the torture chair set up for her, and her arms and legs are instantly restrained…
4154	Karin@r@vkarin0757."*Cough*, *cough* *cough* *cough*"
4155	Karin@r@vkarin0758."Are you for real…? Are you for real, Fuuka…?"
4156	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0713."All it took was for me to say how disgusting you are, for Dark Fuuka to finally be awakened…"
4157	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0714."Doremi, and Mina too, listen. And try to understand."
4158	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0715."There is no way out of this room other than sacrificing one person as the @b.@<Condemned@>."
4159	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0716."What that means, specifically, is that we have to choose whether to sacrifice you, Mina-chan, or perhaps Karin."
4160	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0717."You wanna be @b.@<Condemned@> again after all? You said that you'd found the resolve, and with such conviction…"
4161	Mina@r@vmina0695."…*huff*… *huff*…"
4162	Mina@r@vmina0696."N-no one wants to die…. But, that's why surviving by sacrificing someone else is…"
4163	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0718."Alright, I suppose I'll make you the @b.@<Condemned@> again. Then we'll pull your torture lever right away."
4164	Mina@r@vmina0697.@z150."NO!!! NO NO NO, NOOOo!!!"
4165	Mina@r@vmina0698.@z132."MINA DOESN'T WANNA DIE, DOESN'T WANNA DIEE!! SHE WON'T BE @b.@<CONDEMNED@>, ABSOLUTELY NOT!!"
4166	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0719."Right, right, that's fine. There's no time left after all. Let's just say how we really feel."
4167	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0720."And you, Doremi? Between Mina-chan and Karin, who do you want @b.@<Condemned@>?"
4168	Doremi@r@vdoremi0710."…Eh… there's no way I could choose…"
4169	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0721."Yeah. That's why I've accepted the role of choosing. And I chose Karin."
4170	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0722."Doremi, your role as the other @b.@<Judge@>… is only to pull the torture lever on the torture chair the @b.@<Condemned@> sits in."
4171	Doremi@r@vdoremi0711."*sob*…"
4172	Karin@r@vkarin0759."Doremi… are you gonna let me die just to save yourself? You can't do something like that, can you? Aren't we supposed to be friends…?"
4173	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0723."You were pretty nonchalant about cornering your so-called friend, Mina-chan, into accepting her death, weren't you?"
4174	Karin@r@vkarin0760.@z150."YOU REALLY THINK OF ME LIKE THAT, FUUKA-?! ENOUGH OF THAT!!"
4175	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0724."Between Mina-chan and Karin. Which one is your dearly beloved friend, Doremi?"
4176	Doremi@r@vdoremi0712."…Th… that's…"
4177	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0725."Okay, what if we think of it differently? Between Mina-chan and Karin, who do you think could withstand the torture?"
4178	Doremi@r@vdoremi0713."………"
4179	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0726."The culprit only said she'd feel horrible agony, but not necessarily to the point of death."
4180	Karin@r@vkarin0761."If you get left behind in a room like this, it doesn't matter if you get tortured or whatever, you'll still obviously die!!"
4181	@rFuuka speaks into Doremi's ear as if whispering.
4182	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0727."…If everyone in this room dies, won't it be because we ran out of time?"
4183	Doremi@r@vdoremi0714."Eh…"
4184	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0728."I think that if we end the death game in time, the fire will stop."
4185	Doremi@r@vdoremi0715."But… only 3 people will be saved, and saving the @b.@<Condemned@> would be…"
4186	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0729."Maybe that's… something meant to threaten us into moving the death game along, no?"
4187	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0730."Just think about it. If they keep kidnapping people for a death game like this, they'll get caught at some point."
4188	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0731."So don't you think the culprit would want their precious death game participants to last at least a little while so they can be played with…?"
4189	Doremi@r@vdoremi0716."…What he wants to watch is a death game…"
4190	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0732."Right. The culprit is the kind of lowlife who wants to see us disparaging each other, filled with mortal terror, as if it were fine art to him."
4191	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0733."So that's why, although we're cornered like this, he doesn't really want to kill us."
4192	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0734."In a best case scenario, it's even possible that if you pull the torture lever, nothing actually happens."
4193	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0735."We'll agonize, cry and scream, and then find the resolve and pull the lever. In the end, nothing happens, and the culprit applauds, going ‘bravo, bravo’…"
4194	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0736."…So? Doesn't it seem likely?"
4195	Doremi@r@vdoremi0717."…Of course, I… can't deny that possibility… but…"
4196	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0737."Even if, say, some kind of torture actually happened, it's not certain that she'll die."
4197	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0738."Maybe she'll just get a jolt of electricity and it'll be over, like the kind of silly penalty you'd see on a game show."
4198	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0739."And then, Karin will be released, and the culprit will be like, ‘I absolutely won't lose in the next death game!’ That's good for him, right…?"
4199	@rWhat Fuuka is saying has no basis and no guarantees.
4200	@rDoremi understands this too, but she doesn't contest it…
4201	Doremi@r@vdoremi0718."………"
4202	Karin@r@vkarin0762."Yo, Doremi? Get ahold of yourself!! We're supposed to be friends, aren't we?!"
4203	Doremi@r@vdoremi0719."…Karin… apologies, but just accept it for us."
4204	Doremi@r@vdoremi0720."I don't know what's going to happen when I pull the torture lever…"
4205	Doremi@r@vdoremi0721."But, compared to the frail Mina, you might still be able to manage…!"
4206	Karin@r@vkarin0763.@z138."UOOOoOOAAaAAAAAH, DON'T, FUCK WITH, MEEEEeEEEEEE!!!"
4207	Karin@r@vkarin0764.@z113."MINA SAID, SHE'D SACRIFICE HERSELF, DIDN'T SHE?!?! MAKE IT MINA, MAKE IT HEEEEeEEeR!!"
4208	Karin@r@vkarin0765."Yo, Mina, say something!! You really wanna just sacrifice me like that just so you can survive?!?!"
4209	Mina@r@vmina0699."But, but, but… Mina doesn't wanna die either…!!"
4210	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0740."Mina-chan had the resolve to see her role through as the @b.@<Condemned@>, but that was just when she was @b.@<Condemned@>."
4211	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0741."She isn't the @b.@<Condemned@> anymore, so she no longer needs the resolve for self-sacrifice."
4212	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0742."Karin, when Mina-chan showed that resolve, you praised her for it, didn't you?"
4213	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0743."With things like ‘ultimate courage’ and ‘accepting Mina's resolve’ or something, and ‘I truly thank you, Mina.’ Was that it?"
4214	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0744."And so, this time I'll say that for you."
4215	Karin@r@vkarin0766.@z132."I'LL KILL YOU, I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU, YOU CUNT!!! I'LL BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU, WAAAaAAAH!!!"
4216	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0745."I truly thank you. We won't let your sacrifice be in vain, okay?"
4217	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0746."We'll accept your resolve and get out of this room alive."
4218	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0747."And then, we'll beat the crap out of the culprit for you, okay? I promise."
4219	Karin@r@vkarin0767.@z113."FUCK YOU, YOU CUUUUNT!!! KILL, I'LL FUCKING BASH YOUR SKULL, FUUKA YOU CUNT, I'LL MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF IT!!! WAAAaAAAAAAH!!"
4220	@rHer angry shouts are like death screams. …Doremi and Mina endure it with their eyes tightly shut, but it doesn't even seem to reach Fuuka's ears.
4221	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0748."There's no time. For real this time."
4222	Mina@r@vmina0700."M-my shoes are getting burnt, they're melting…?!"
4223	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0749."Doremi. Only your job is left."
4224	Doremi@r@vdoremi0722."…*shock*…"
4225	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0750."When Mina-chan was @b.@<Condemned@>, she found the resolve. I've made the decision to sacrifice Karin."
4226	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0751."So the job you have to do is already decided…"
4227	@rKarin keeps on yelling and yelling. Her angry shouts continue into screams.
4228	@rBut, the three of them are already pretending they can't hear her…
4229	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0751a."Guilty."
4230	Doremi@r@vdoremi0723."…*Huff*… *huff*… *huff*."
4231	Karin@r@vkarin0768.@z147."STOP RIGHT NOWwWWwWW!! DON'T YOU FUCKING, DARE PULL THAT LEVEeR!!"
4232	Karin@r@vkarin0769.@z132."IF YOU PULL IT I'LL KILL YOU, I'LL MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE I KILL YOU!! NO MATTER WHAaT, I WILL FUCKING KILL YOUuUUUUUuUU!!"
4233	Doremi@r@vdoremi0724."K-Karin…"
4234	Doremi@r@vdoremi0725."…There's nothing else to do… sorry…"
4235	Karin@r@vkarin0770.@z132."YOU'D BETTER FUCKING REMEMBER THIS, I'LL MAKE SUuRE YOU FUCKING REMEMBER THIiIIIIiIIS!!!"
4236	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0752."Karin, the spirit of Kamen Kendo, the ally of justice, sleeps within you, right?"
4237	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0753."So fight to protect us. Okay?"
4238	Karin@r@vkarin0771.@z150."F-FUUKAAAaAAAaAAAAaA, OOOoOOAAAAAAH!!!"

4239	Mina@r@vmina0703."…No way… Karin-chan…"
4240	Mina@r@vmina0704."*sob*… *sob*…"
4241	@rShe has no clue what's going on.
4242	@rEven Doremi, who should be indignant at being treated like she is the culprit, is dumbfounded.
4243	Karin@r@vkarin0775."Normally, if you put two and two together, you'd get pretty quickly that Mina is downright lying."
4244	Karin@r@vkarin0776."If Doremi really were the culprit, she wouldn't have put herself in a dangerous position by being the @b.@<Joker@>."
4245	Karin@r@vkarin0777."That is to say nothing of the fact that there'd be no point in breaking her promise to her accomplice, Mina, by making her the @b.@<Condemned@>."
4246	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0758."If she did that… it would obviously expose their hidden scheme…"
4247	Mina@r@vmina0705."*Hic*, *hic*… fhehhhhhhhhhhhh… ehh…"
4248	Doremi@r@vdoremi0728."…Why… would you tell a lie that would get found out so quickly…?"
4249	Mina@r@vmina0706."Ehhhhhhhhhh, *hic*, ehhhhhhhhhhhhh…"
4250	Doremi@r@vdoremi0729."How come I'm the one getting falsely accused…!"
4251	Mina@r@vmina0707."*Hic*… *hic*…"
4252	Mina@r@vmina0708.@z138."BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA FUCKING DIE, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?! KYA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
4253	Mina@r@vmina0709.@z138."IF I WANNA SURVIVE, ALL I CAN DO IS SMEAR THE @b.@<JOKER@>, AM I WRONG!!"
4254	Mina@r@vmina0710.@z116."COULDN'T YOU HAVE GUESSED?! ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOOoOOoOT?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"
4255	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0759."…Mina… chan…"
4256	Mina@r@vmina0711."I didn't do anything wroong, did I?! You're not gonna make me fucking apologize, are you?!"
4257	Mina@r@vmina0712."I mean, the moment this started, I could see the conviction in your eyes, y'know?"
4258	Mina@r@vmina0713."You would all say you'd look for a way to ‘save Mina until the last minute,’ but only waste time!"
4259	Mina@r@vmina0714.@z96."Because in the end, are the three of you are gonna apologize and let me die? Or will you say something like ‘we'll be together with you until the end’ while we all hold hands and die together?"
4260	Mina@r@vmina0715.@z122."'CAUSE I KNEW RIGHT AWAY THESE WERE THE ONLY OPTIONS, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"
4261	Mina@r@vmina0716."Whatever you do, I still die, so I had no fucking choice, y'know?! All I could do was play the game, y'know?!"
4262	Mina@r@vmina0717."I've been showering you all with affection as your cute, cute mascot, all for today, doncha know?! And I thought for sure it'd work!!"
4263	Mina@r@vmina0718."But, I never thought, I really never thought that…!!!"
4264	Mina@r@vmina0719."Karin-chan… wouldn't actually trust me… hahaha, hahahahahahahahaha…!!"
4265	Mina@r@vmina0720."You guys must think I'm soo fucking scary right now, but,"
4266	Mina@r@vmina0721."To me… by the one I always believed to be my bestie ever since elementary school, who I always hung out with…"
4267	Mina@r@vmina0722."Being told by Karin-chan that she never trusted me… is way scarier!!"
4268	@rMina continues laughing with an uncanny cackle.
4269	@rEven Fuuka, even Doremi… can only stand there, dumbfounded…
4270	Karin@r@vkarin0778."But… right now, there is one thing I can be thankful to you for, Mina."
4271	Karin@r@vkarin0779."With this, we can choose the simpler way to escape."
4272	@rAt the same time, the flames under the floor are all increasing in intensity.
4273	@rThe remaining time is about 2 minutes. …Whatever they decide to do, there's no more time to hesitate.
4274	Doremi@r@vdoremi0730."A simple… way to escape…?"
4275	Karin@r@vkarin0780."We pull Mina's torture lever."
4276	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0760."…Karin…!,"
4277	Karin@r@vkarin0781."The culprit said the torture would be the agony of near death. …But he didn't quite say she'd die."
4278	Karin@r@vkarin0782."If she endures it for us… we'll be able to escape at once. Then, we can find some key or tool and come back to save Mina."
4279	Doremi@r@vdoremi0731."………"
4280	Doremi@r@vdoremi0732."…I have no objections."
4281	Doremi@r@vdoremi0733."I'll have her make up for trying to falsely accuse me…"
4282	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0761."…Doremi-chan…"
4283	Doremi@r@vdoremi0734."But once it's over, we'll be friends again. …So, I'll come back and save you."
4284	Mina@r@vmina0723.@z150."KYA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA…! EVEN WITH ONLY ONE MINUTE LEFT?"
4285	Mina@r@vmina0724."How can you come back in time to save me?!"
4286	Mina@r@vmina0725."Anyway, you know what?"
4287	Mina@r@vmina0726."I've, like, always really hated you, Doremi, for a long time now! Friends? Thank you, but I'll decline the offer!!"
4288	Doremi@r@vdoremi0735."…Stop it… Mina… *sob*…"
4289	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0762."Sorry, Mina-chan."
4290	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0763."We'll definitely hurry back to save you, alright?"
4291	@rThe only other @b.@<Judge@>, the one who can operate the torture lever, is Fuuka.
4292	@rFuuka readies herself and then reaches for the torture lever that's standing up underneath Mina…
4293	Mina@r@vmina0727.@z133."NGHHHH-GHHHHHHH-GH, AH, AAaAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAAAH!!!"
4294	@rMina's scream is enough to chill even her own blood. However, at the same time, the mechanisms in the collars of the other three make a clicking sound.
4295	@rThey fumble with the screws in their collars and are able to turn them. They can see the elevator door opening, as well.
4296	@rThe girls take their collars off one after the other, and then race into the elevator.
4297	Doremi@r@vdoremi0736."…We'll definitely… come back to save you…"
4298	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0764."You wait too, little boy! We'll definitely come back…"
4299	Boy@r@vm_shou0032."………"
4300	@rHe is inside of a welded cage. A way to save the boy, in addition to saving Mina, probably doesn't exist…
4301	Karin@r@vkarin0783."…Thank you, Mina. Because you showed us your true nature, we were able to make it in time."
4302	Mina@r@vmina0728."Haha, hahahahahahahahahahaha…"
4303	Mina@r@vmina0729."uu… gh… in the end, Karin, I guess I should give you a memento…"
4304	Karin@r@vkarin0784."…What is it?"
4305	Mina@r@vmina0730."Fuuka is right behind you. …Go ahead and ask her. ‘We're best friends, aren't we?’…"
4306	Karin@r@vkarin0785."What're you saying…? Fuuka and I are best friends."
4307	Mina@r@vmina0731."Fine, so just ask her."
4308	Mina@r@vmina0732."…But… the answer you'll get… may surprise you…"
4309	Mina@r@vmina0733."Kya-ha, ha-hahahahahahaha… ha-hahahahahahahahaha…"
4310	@rThick blood spills out from the sides of Mina's mouth, who is still laughing eerily.
4311	@rAnd then, her figure is abruptly swallowed by erupting flames that reach all the way to the ceiling.
4312	@rThe boy in the cage cannot escape from them either…
4313	Mina@r@vmina0734."I guess to you, I'm a subhuman, an animal. You might not expect… that to someone else, maybe it's you that's the subhuman, y'know…?"

4314	Karin@r@vkarin0786."Uwaa, wh-what's this…?!"
4315	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0765."The flames under the floor are getting stronger…!"
4316	Mina@r@vmina0737."…*Huff*, *huff*… *huff*…"
4317	Karin@r@vkarin0787."There's no time left!! What do we do? What do we do?!"
4318	Doremi@r@vdoremi0737."Ha, how obvious…. That this is exactly what you wanted from the start!"
4319	Mina@r@vmina0738."Not guilty, not guilty!"
4320	@rIn only an instant, the @b.@<Joker@>, Fuuka's, chain is pulled taut, then slackened right away.
4321	@rSince a not guilty verdict was made twice, Fuuka was made the @b.@<Condemned@> for just an instant, and then Doremi took her place again immediately afterwards.
4322	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0766."Wh-what was that, just now…"
4323	Mina@r@vmina0739."With that, the right to make verdicts is Mina's."
4324	Mina@r@vmina0740."Which means, that the right to forgive Doremi-chan or not, rests with me."
4325	Mina@r@vmina0741."That also means… the right to have the torture lever called also rests with me."
4326	Karin@r@vkarin0788."…That's right. Unless someone's declared guilty, the torture lever can't be used…"
4327	Mina@r@vmina0742."Bingo. But the one who pulls the torture lever can only be the other @b.@<Judge@>, Karin-chan,"
4328	Mina@r@vmina0743."But now only I can give her permission to do that."
4329	Doremi@r@vdoremi0738."…Minaaa…"
4330	Mina@r@vmina0744."Doremi-chan, during our little dispute… I might have, like, snapped a bit."
4331	Mina@r@vmina0745."…At first, with us getting trapped in this ominous locked room, the panic got to my head."
4332	Mina@r@vmina0746."But right now, I feel like it doesn't really matter."
4333	Mina@r@vmina0747."Or rather… that I die or not doesn't matter at all."
4334	Mina@r@vmina0748.@z138."APOLOGIZE!! FUCKING APOLOGIZE TO ME RIGHT NOW, HANABUSA DOREMI!!!"
4335	Mina@r@vmina0749.@z138."IF I DON'T HEAR YOU SAY ‘I'M SORRY,’ I CAN'T EVEN GO TO HELL!!!"
4336	Karin@r@vkarin0789."C-cut it out, Mina! What the hell are you even doing at a time like this…?!"
4337	Mina@r@vmina0750."Don't you think this is exactly the right time…?"
4338	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0767."Mina-chan, have you gone mad?! Get ahold of yourself…!!"
4339	Mina@r@vmina0751.@z132."HOW AM I NOT THE SANEST ONE HERE IN THIS SITUATION?! IT'S YOU GUYS THAT ARE STILL HALF ASLEEP!!"
4340	Mina@r@vmina0752."Or like, if you don't want to die, you'd better not lay a goddamn finger on me!!"
4341	Mina@r@vmina0753."If I don't let you pull the torture lever, everyone here fucking dies, right?! So don't get in my wayyyy!!"
4342	Karin@r@vkarin0790."M-Mina…"
4343	@rAs long as Mina doesn't say the word ‘guilty,’ the torture lever can't be pulled.
4344	@rIn other words, even if Mina goes insane and chooses for everyone here to die, no one can get in her way…
4345	Mina@r@vmina0754."Hey!! Doremi-chan, apologize!! Fucking apologize to me!!"
4346	Doremi@r@vdoremi0739."…Getting soaked in the rain… was your own fault…"
4347	Mina@r@vmina0755.@z131."SHUT YOUR MOUTH!! APOLOGIZE, APOLGOIiIZE!! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, IT'S YOU WHO WERE IN THE WRONG, DOREMI!!"
4348	Karin@r@vkarin0791."M-Mina… enough…"
4349	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0768."………"
4350	@rShe should be stopping her savagery, but in this extreme situation, in this extreme state, reason won't get through to Mina.
4351	@rSo, with no time left whatsoever, Mina grips the key to the only way to survive.
4352	@rAll Karin and Fuuka can do… is try not to make Mina's mood worse, and go about things calmly…
4353	Mina@r@vmina0756."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*…!"
4354	Doremi@r@vdoremi0740."…Having fun…? Is this refreshing…?"
4355	Doremi@r@vdoremi0741."Aren't you… losing track of what you're doing, what you're trying to do…?"
4356	Mina@r@vmina0757.@z132."I DON'T CARE IF IT'S SELF-INDULGENT, I'M TELLING YOU TO FUCKING APOLOGIZE, DOREMI-CHAaAAN!!!"
4357	Doremi@r@vdoremi0742."…Who'd… apologize…?"
4358	Doremi@r@vdoremi0743."Even if I did… it's not like it'd save me anyway, am I wrong…?"
4359	Mina@r@vmina0758."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*, *huff*"
4360	Doremi@r@vdoremi0744."So… apologizing to you… wouldn't accomplish a damn thing."
4361	Mina@r@vmina0759."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*, *huuff*"
4362	Karin@r@vkarin0792."Y-yo, Mina, c-careful with that chain…"
4363	@rMina is gripping and coiling the chain connected to her own neck, raising it up to be used as a deadly weapon…
4364	@rA beating with bare hands is one thing, but if Doremi were beaten with something like this…
4365	Mina@r@vmina0760.@z150."FINE WITH ME!!! DON'T APOLOGIZE, THEN!!! DIE, JUST FUCKING DIE!!!"
4366	Mina@r@vmina0761."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*, *huff*,"
4367	Mina@r@vmina0762."How's that! Do you get it now?! Do you regret it?! are you ready to apologize…?!"
4368	Mina@r@vmina0763."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*… *huff*…"
4369	Doremi@r@vdoremi0745."………"
4370	@rDoremi still seems to be alive.
4371	@rHowever, her face is stained thick with blood, her eyelids and cheeks disfigured and swollen up…
4372	@rBut somehow… she is still able to get words out.
4373	Doremi@r@vdoremi0746."…You… done yet…?"
4374	Mina@r@vmina0764."…Who knows. …Not sure."
4375	Mina@r@vmina0765."But, whatever. I give up."
4376	Doremi@r@vdoremi0747."…Finally. …Now, say I'm guilty already and get it over with…"
4377	Doremi@r@vdoremi0748."Come on, there's no time left…"
4378	Mina@r@vmina0766."I guess you're right. Guilty."
4379	@rAt Mina's guilty verdict, some kind of mechanical sound can be heard from Doremi's torture chair.
4380	@rThe lever on Doremi's torture chair has become operational…
4381	Mina@r@vmina0767."Alright, Karin-chan. The torture lever, if you would."
4382	Mina@r@vmina0768."………? Whatcha making that scary face for?"
4383	Karin@r@vkarin0793."…Listen to your own damn heart…"
4384	Mina@r@vmina0769."But isn't Doremi-chan gonna die anyway?"
4385	Mina@r@vmina0770."So, before she dies, shouldn't Mina at least get some closure for her grudge?"
4386	Karin@r@vkarin0794."………"
4387	Karin@r@vkarin0795."…You'd go this far for some grudge?"
4388	Mina@r@vmina0771."Well, for me… it'd be hard to make this grudge of mine, that has tormented me ever since elementary school, even worse."
4389	Mina@r@vmina0772."So, like… won't you stop looking at Mina with that scary look?"
4390	Mina@r@vmina0773."No one else besides Mina can grant you permission to pull the torture lever, right?"
4391	Karin@r@vkarin0796."Maybe so. …I've gotten used to feeling that way, as well."
4392	Mina@r@vmina0774."Huh…?"
4393	Karin@r@vkarin0797."…Maybe I also have, like, kinda snapped…"
4394	Mina@r@vmina0775."…What's this about…?"
4395	Karin@r@vkarin0798."I was scared too. I didn't wanna die too. …I wanted to survive with all my heart, so I just stayed calm."
4396	Karin@r@vkarin0799."But right now, I feel like it doesn't really matter."
4397	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0769."K-Karin…? What are you saying…?"
4398	Karin@r@vkarin0800."I feel… the same way as Mina about this."
4399	Karin@r@vkarin0801."So, with that in mind… I just feel like there's no need to hold back, I guess."
4400	Mina@r@vmina0776."Wait, I dunno what you're talking about… and more importantly, there's no time left at all, so—"
4401	Karin@r@vkarin0802."It's fine. Who cares about the time?"
4402	Mina@r@vmina0777."…Eh?"
4403	Karin@r@vkarin0803."That's my line. The hell are you saying that for…?"
4404	Karin@r@vkarin0804."You don't care about the time, or whether or not you die, right? Didn't you say that earlier…?"
4405	Karin@r@vkarin0805."Well, watching you vomit out all that past grudge, it looked refreshing. So I feel like it'd be nice for me too."
4406	Karin@r@vkarin0806."So, you know… it's like I've finally snapped as well."
4407	Mina@r@vmina0778."………"
4408	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0770."Not you too, Karin…! What are you trying to say…?!"
4409	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0771.@z132."CAN'T YOU SEE THERE'S NO TIME?! CAN'T YOU SEE THE FLAMES AT OUR FEET KEEP GETTING STRONGER?!"
4410	Karin@r@vkarin0807."Haa, can you please quiet down, Fuuka? Making my mood worse won't help things at all, y'know?"
4411	Karin@r@vkarin0808."Only Mina can make it possible to pull the torture lever, but only I can actually pull that lever."
4412	Mina@r@vmina0779."…Karin-chan…? What are you saying…?"
4413	Mina@r@vmina0780."If you pull Doremi-chan's torture lever, all three of us can survive, you know…?"
4414	Karin@r@vkarin0809."And what are YOU talking about, Mina…?"
4415	Karin@r@vkarin0810."Even after you said you don't care whether you live or die… I guess you're scared of death after all?"
4416	Mina@r@vmina0781."………"
4417	@rAlthough an ever more intense expression is rising to Mina's face, it's clear that she is rattled.
4418	@rThere is barely any time remaining. Very soon, they will have to pull the torture lever and escape, one might think.
4419	@rSo then, what is Karin doing…? What is she thinking? Mina can't understand her…
4420	Karin@r@vkarin0811."Hey."
4421	Mina@r@vmina0782."Wh-what…"
4422	Karin@r@vkarin0812."About that grudge of yours… I thought ‘I'm glad that's the extent of it.’"
4423	Karin@r@vkarin0813."‘So it's okay if I spit out all my grudge to that extent,’ or so I understood."
4424	Karin@r@vkarin0814."…Well, it made me snap… or rather, maybe I feel refreshed now or something."
4425	Mina@r@vmina0783."Karin-chan, I dunno what you're talking about, but either way, if you want us to escape from—"
4426	Karin@r@vkarin0815.@z139."HOW ABOUT —YOU— APOLOGIZE TO ME!! I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, YUASA MINA!!!"
4427	Mina@r@vmina0784."…Eh…?"
4428	Karin@r@vkarin0816."Maybe you don't remember either. But either way, I won't!"
4429	Karin@r@vkarin0817."Even though you promised we'd go together! You never came… I never forgave you and I never fucking forgot about it!!!"
4430	Mina@r@vmina0785."…Eh… eh…?"
4431	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0772.@z150."TH-THIS IS B-BAD, THE FIRE! THE FLAMES ARE- EEK…!!"
4432	Karin@r@vkarin0818."If you think it's fine to take your revenge on Doremi this far…"
4433	Karin@r@vkarin0819."Then I too… can take my revenge on you, just a little bit."
4434	Mina@r@vmina0786."What's this about… I really don't get it…! A-anyway, we don't have—"
4435	Karin@r@vkarin0820."Even though you betrayed me so horribly… you don't even fucking remember it, do you?"
4436	Karin@r@vkarin0821."Haha… I could just laugh. …Hahahahaha."
4437	Mina@r@vmina0787.@z114."F-FINE, NOW HURRY UP AND PULL THE DAMN TORTURE LEVER…!! I'LL APOLOGIZE AFTERWARDS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT, SO HURRY, THE LEVER!!"
4438	Karin@r@vkarin0822.@z92."You apologize first! …Get down on the floor, on your hands and knees and fucking apologize. Maybe if you press your face into this burning hot mesh and grill yourself, I'll think about forgiving you…!"
4439	Mina@r@vmina0788."…L-like I would do that!!"
4440	Karin@r@vkarin0823."Alright, let's die, then…. I don't feel any particular need to go home alive anymore…"
4441	Mina@r@vmina0789."K… Karin… chan…"
4442	Karin@r@vkarin0824."Apologize."
4443	Karin@r@vkarin0825.@z132."GET DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES, AND FUCKING GRILL YOUR FACE ON THE MEEEeEEeESH!!!"
4444	Mina@r@vmina0790.@z132."WHO THE HELL WOULD DO THAaAAaAAAT!!! FINE BY ME, WHY DON'T WE BURN TO DEATH HERE TOGETHEeER?!?!"
4445	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0773."S-stop it, both of you, stop it, stop it, stop it!"
4446	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0774.@z166."STOP IiIIIIIIiIIIiIIIIT!!!"

4447	@rAt this point, the blue flames erupting from under the floor are increasing in strength all at once.
4448	@rJudging by the clock, there might be about 2 minutes left…
4449	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0775."Calm down! Both of you, calm down!"
4450	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0776."This situation is what's making you exchange such violent words right now!"
4451	Mina@r@vmina0791."The @b.@<Judge@>s are me and Fuuka-chan, right?"
4452	Mina@r@vmina0792."It's either Doremi-chan or Karin-chan. I know we have to decide which one we're going to sacrifice, but,"
4453	Mina@r@vmina0793."I… won't do my job at all if we make Karin-chan @b.@<Condemned@>."
4454	Doremi@r@vdoremi0753."…Mina… you'd go that far…"
4455	Doremi@r@vdoremi0754."You really hate me that muuuuch?! @z150.SCREW YOUUUUU!!!@z100."
4456	Mina@r@vmina0794."It's either Doremi-chan or Karin-chan. It's only a question of who we like more."
4457	Mina@r@vmina0795."And I really love Karin-chan. …Every time I'm getting bullied, she always comes to save me."
4458	Mina@r@vmina0796."So, don't worry, Karin-chan. I'd never allow anyone to sacrifice you, no matter what!"
4459	Karin@r@vkarin0826."…M… Mina…"
4460	@rThe two @b.@<Judges@> take on separate roles — one makes the guilty verdict, and one operates the torture lever.
4461	@rIf they both boycott each other, the torture can't be carried out. That is to say, they can't escape.
4462	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0777."…When you put it that way…"
4463	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0778."If you try to carry out the sacrifice using Doremi… I won't do my job either."
4464	Mina@r@vmina0797."Eh…?"
4465	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0779."We're weighing Doremi's life against Karin's."
4466	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0780."So, I… I apologize but I'm saving Doremi."
4467	Karin@r@vkarin0827."F-Fuuka…?!"
4468	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0781."Don't think bad of me, okay, Karin? …It's not like I'm saying I hate you."
4469	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0782."It's just, I agree with Doremi that you have the sturdiest body, so you should be able to withstand the torture."
4470	Mina@r@vmina0798."…Is that really so? Even though… you were looking at her with such cold eyes just now?"
4471	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0783."You're just imagining things. I'm calm. This is just the best way for all of us to get out of here."
4472	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0784."Can I ask this of you, Karin? It's Kamen Kendo's turn now, isn't it? Take the place of the captured hostage."
4473	Doremi@r@vdoremi0755."…It's alright. If it's you, Karin, I'm sure you'll be alright no matter what."
4474	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0785."Doremi's body isn't that sturdy. You know that, right? If you do, will you still let her die?"
4475	Karin@r@vkarin0828."U… uuu……"
4476	Mina@r@vmina0799.@z150."DON'T BULLY KARIN-CHAN!! SHE IS STILL A GIRL!!!"
4477	Mina@r@vmina0800."It's not that Doremi-chan's body isn't sturdy, she just has no athletic skill!"
4478	Mina@r@vmina0801."Karin-chan is very athletic, but however sturdy her body is, it's no different from Doremi's!"
4479	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0786."Even if that's the case, if I'm going to save someone, I'm going to save Doremi."
4480	Mina@r@vmina0802."I won't let you! We're saving Karin-chan no matter what!"
4481	Mina@r@vmina0803."Even if you say ‘not guilty’ and make Karin-chan the @b.@<Condemned@>,"
4482	Mina@r@vmina0804."I absolutely won't pull the torture lever!! Even if it means everyone here burns to death!!"
4483	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0787."It's the same for me!! I'd never pull Doremi's torture lever, no matter what!"
4484	Doremi@r@vdoremi0756.@z150."HAHAHA, A-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA…!!"
4485	@rDoremi starts laughing with a broken expression.
4486	@rBut, Karin feels the same.
4487	@rThey're in Hell. …This place is Hell…
4488	Doremi@r@vdoremi0757."…Fuuka. Say ‘not guilty.’"
4489	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0788."N-not guilty!"
4490	@rAs she says this, the chain attached to Karin's collar is vigorously reeled in.
4491	@rKarin's body is quickly dragged into the torture chair and her limbs are bound by the shackles…
4492	Mina@r@vmina0805."Karin-chan…?!"
4493	Karin@r@vkarin0829."Au, gh… *cough*, *cough*…!"
4494	Doremi@r@vdoremi0613a."Guilty!"
4495	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0751a."Guilty."
4496	Mina@r@vmina0806."H-how dare you…!"
4497	Doremi@r@vdoremi0758."…I guess you're an idiot… after all…"
4498	Doremi@r@vdoremi0759."Don't tell me you… thought the @b.@<Judges@> were on equal terms…?"
4499	@rDoremi's expression twists into a creepy smile as she slowly… stands up from the torture chair she was released from.
4500	Doremi@r@vdoremi0760."You must know the @b.@<Judge@> who makes the verdict and the @b.@<Judge@> who operates the torture lever… aren't in the same position, right…?"
4501	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0789."…No way… Doremi…"
4502	Doremi@r@vdoremi0761."If you're not alive, you can't make the verdict. But as long as you have the @b.@<Judge@>'s hand, you can still operate the torture lever."
4503	Doremi@r@vdoremi0762."The @b.@<Judge@> in charge of the torture lever can still do her job even if she's not alive, you know…?"
4504	Karin@r@vkarin0830."B-back off, Doremi…! What are you thinking?"
4505	Doremi@r@vdoremi0763."Of course, I don't want to be so rash…"
4506	Doremi@r@vdoremi0764."The three of us went to such trouble in order to survive… it'd be such a waste to lose one person…"
4507	Mina@r@vmina0807."…Ha… haha-ha! I'm not scared of you…!"
4508	Mina@r@vmina0808."I always thought that you were the type of bitch to betray someone's feelings! It's actually a relief that you've finally shown us your true colors!"
4509	Doremi@r@vdoremi0765."…Fuuka. Let's survive together."
4510	Doremi@r@vdoremi0766."Mina has stubbornly planned to go down with Karin. …In other words, she's already prepared to die."
4511	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0790."…*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*…"
4512	Doremi@r@vdoremi0767."Why should I feel guilt… for granting death to a person who is prepared for it…?"
4513	Mina@r@vmina0809."…You piece of shit, you piece of shit… you pile of vomit…!!"
4514	Doremi@r@vdoremi0768."Fuuka and I will ‘persuade’ you together, Mina."
4515	Doremi@r@vdoremi0769."If you can understand your situation, the three of us can all survive. But, if that doesn't work…"
4516	Doremi@r@vdoremi0770."Then if we want the best case scenario, we'll have no other choice. …Only two of us can survive."
4517	Karin@r@vkarin0831."F-Fuuka…! I don't know exactly why you hate me, but,"
4518	Karin@r@vkarin0832."Can you really trust someone like Doremi, who can say so callously that she'd kill her friend?!"
4519	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0791."…*sob*… *sob*,"
4520	@rJust a minute ago, she was taking a position against Mina.
4521	@rThis is just her reflexive reply to Mina's incitement that she would let her best friend Doremi die.
4522	@rFuuka doesn't actually feel like letting anyone die.
4523	@rHowever, in this situation, all the verbal abuse has her bewildered.
4524	@rHer true intention is to make the wisest move so everyone will survive this stalemate situation. So she wants to alter the course accordingly.
4525	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0792."…This isn't about… who we let die, or who we sacrifice…"
4526	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0793."It's about thinking of a way for the four of us to survive…!"
4527	@rAt this point… a chain is suddenly wrapped around Fuuka's neck from behind.
4528	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0794."Agh-…………-…………?!?!"
4529	Doremi@r@vdoremi0771."…I guess the princess is still a princeess after all…"
4530	Doremi@r@vdoremi0772."Even in an emergency situation… like this… she'll still try to sugarcoat it aaaall…!"
4531	@rDoremi is tightening the chain attached to her collar, now wrapped around Fuuka's neck, with terrifying force…
4532	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0795."ughhh……-gh……… a…………,"
4533	Karin@r@vkarin0833."D-Doremi…! Cut it out! Let go of Fuuka, dammit!!"
4534	Mina@r@vmina0810.@z150."…S-STOP IIIIIiT…!!"
4535	@rWhen Mina tries to tackle Doremi… Fuuka falls to her knees.
4536	@rThere is a sizzling sound… as Fuuka's knees are burned on the red-hot mesh. Without letting out a single noise… she falls flat on her face…
4537	@rFuuka's long, beautiful hair instantly becomes burnt. Its foul odor starts filling the room.
4538	Doremi@r@vdoremi0773."…I guess this is what they call the adrenaline rush at the scene of a fire…"
4539	Doremi@r@vdoremi0774."It feels like… something switched on. …Pretty incredible, huh… the power that the fire scene gives you…"
4540	Karin@r@vkarin0834.@z144."FUUKA, FUUKAaAAaAAaA!! SHIT, SHIT, FUCK THIS SHIT!! DOREMI!! HOW DARE YOU!!!"
4541	Mina@r@vmina0811."…Killing Fuuka-chan… even though she was protecting you…"
4542	Doremi@r@vdoremi0775."If her true intent was to protect me, I wouldn't have killed her…"
4543	Doremi@r@vdoremi0776."But Fuuka… said we had to kill you, Mina, so… I pulled that chain."
4544	Doremi@r@vdoremi0777."If she'd had a change of heart and said not guilty again, I'd be put back in the torture chair."
4545	Doremi@r@vdoremi0778."…You see, the @b.@<Judges@>…… don't exactly have the advantage."
4546	Doremi@r@vdoremi0779."They have to be aware… that they're in a position where they're in danger of getting killed themselves…"
4547	Mina@r@vmina0812."…Doremi…!!"
4548	Doremi@r@vdoremi0780."Now… the number of people that can survive… is either one or two."
4549	Doremi@r@vdoremi0781."…And my place among those is already decided."
4550	Doremi@r@vdoremi0782."If you'd like to be the other person… Mina… I'd like you to cooperate with me…"
4551	Karin@r@vkarin0835."M… Mina…"
4552	Mina@r@vmina0813."…I won't abandon you, Karin-chan. This time, I'll protect you!!"
4553	Doremi@r@vdoremi0783.@z150."HAHA, HA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
4554	@rSlowly… a hellish demon in the shape of Doremi… advances on Mina, pulling on the chain of Hell…
4555	@rLetting out a battlecry that isn't quite a shriek or a scream… Mina, no, Doremi, both grab at each other.
4556	@r……They curse at each other, grapple each other, and tumble around.
4557	@rTheir bodies are burned on the red-hot mesh, their charred skin is torn off… and even still, there is no end to this scuffle in the depths of Hell…
4558	@rAt this point, a terrible sound can be heard, and pillars of fire erupt all the way to the ceiling, sequentially, in the four corners of the room.
4559	@rJudging by the clock… it seems the time is up. They're out of time.
4560	@rThe pillars of fire, violently flaring up as if to surround them one after the other… finally surround the girls… and swallow them…

# 05_gameB前半12 (first half 12)
4561	@rFor a short while, everyone is dumbfounded, and their words escape them…
4562	→4561
4563	→4561
4564	Mina@r@vmina0814."…Mina doesn't get it… doesn't get it…"
4565	@rMina's pupils seem to have lost their focus, after she was shredded to pieces by Karin's knife of words, who she believed was her best friend…
4566	Doremi@r@vdoremi0784."K… Karin…"
4567	Doremi@r@vdoremi0785."What… you saying all of a sudden, at a time like this…?!"
4568	Karin@r@vkarin0840."It's because it's a time like this… I thought it'd be better to clearly say what I'm really feeling."
4569	Doremi@r@vdoremi0786.@z150."WHAT FEELINGS?!"
4570	Karin@r@vkarin0841."If we really have to sacrifice someone, I recommend Mina."
4571	Doremi@r@vdoremi0787.@z150."YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DECIDE THAT!!"
4572	Karin@r@vkarin0842."The @b.@<Judge@> here is me."
4573	Karin@r@vkarin0843."And the only one who has the right to declare her guilty or not guilty is me."
4574	Doremi@r@vdoremi0788."Then, then, hurry up and declare Mina not guilty!"
4575	Doremi@r@vdoremi0789.@z150."I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SACRIFICING HER IN ORDER TO SURVIVE!"
4576	Mina@r@vmina0815."…Doremi-chan…"
4577	Doremi@r@vdoremi0790.@z150."HURRY UP AND MAKE ME THE @b.@<CONDEMNED@> AGAIN! I'M ALREADY PREPARED TO DIE!!"
4578	Karin@r@vkarin0844."………"
4579	Karin@r@vkarin0845."…How noble, for real. You really are noble, Doremi."
4580	Karin@r@vkarin0846."My bad but, Doremi, throwing your life away for Mina is not worth it."
4581	Karin@r@vkarin0847."If this is a situation where one person has to die, it would suit this little worm the best."
4582	Doremi@r@vdoremi0791.@z172."DON'T CALL HER A WORM!!!"
4583	Doremi@r@vdoremi0792."I know you have some problems with Mina, I see your antipathy!"
4584	Doremi@r@vdoremi0793.@z150."BUT THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, NOT MINE!"
4585	Karin@r@vkarin0848."You mean… it has nothing to do with the fact that Mina and I were best friends?"
4586	Karin@r@vkarin0849."Doesn't Mina like, suuper hate you, Doremi…?"
4587	Mina@r@vmina0816.@z150."T-THAT'S A LIEeEEE!!!!"
4588	Mina@r@vmina0817.@z116."MINA HATING DOREMI-CHAN, H-H-HATING HER, IS, is, A LIEeEE!!"
4589	Mina@r@vmina0818.@z116."MINA NEVER SAID THAT, SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT!! NEVER, NEVER EVER!! SHE NEVER ONCE SAID THAAAAaAT!!"
4590	Mina@r@vmina0819.@z116."WAH, AAAH, NGAAaAAAAAAAAAaAAAH!!!"
4591	Doremi@r@vdoremi0794."…M… Mina…"
4592	Mina@r@vmina0820.@z116."SHE NEVER SAID IT!! SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING BAD ABOUT DOREMI-CHAN!! NEeVEEEeER!!"
4593	@rShowing an expression one wouldn't think her to be capable of, Mina's words have already given way to repeated screams…
4594	Karin@r@vkarin0850."You always act like a cutesy mascot in front of people and spread your affection around."
4595	Karin@r@vkarin0851."Especially around you, Doremi. Her attitude changes quite a bit when you're not here…!"
4596	Karin@r@vkarin0852."Right, Fuuka? Didn't you hear her badmouthing Doremi as well, once or twice, when she wasn't in her seat?"
4597	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0796."………"
4598	Mina@r@vmina0821.@z133."MINA NEVER SAID IT, SHE NEVER SAID IIIIiiIIiIIT!! NNGAAaAAAAAAaAAAH!!!"
4599	Doremi@r@vdoremi0795."………"
4600	Doremi@r@vdoremi0796."…Calm down, Mina. I don't pay it any mind."
4601	Mina@r@vmina0822."Doremi… chan…?"
4602	Doremi@r@vdoremi0797."I'm not a sophisticated woman."
4603	Doremi@r@vdoremi0798."…You act like we're best friends on the surface, but in truth you ridicule me. …I get it."
4604	Doremi@r@vdoremi0799."But… friendship isn't a mutual thing. Isn't it something you mainly have for your own sake…?"
4605	Karin@r@vkarin0853."………"
4606	Doremi@r@vdoremi0800."I've never thought of myself as a saint."
4607	Doremi@r@vdoremi0801."How would I be able to say I've never once done something to be resented by someone…?"
4608	Doremi@r@vdoremi0802."So… even if, say, Mina is unhappy with me… I guess it doesn't shock me."
4609	Doremi@r@vdoremi0803."Rather, I want to thank her."
4610	Mina@r@vmina0823."…Eh…?"
4611	Doremi@r@vdoremi0804."Whatever you might've really thought of me… you made sure I didn't feel it from you. Thank you."
4612	Doremi@r@vdoremi0805."Whatever you really think of me, Mina… it's of no concern to me."
4613	Doremi@r@vdoremi0806."Back in second year of middle school… you were always the closest to me during my hardest times."
4614	Doremi@r@vdoremi0807."Just getting that from you… is worth three or four lifetimes to me."
4615	Doremi@r@vdoremi0808."If I think of it that way… giving just one of those lifetimes back to you is no problem for me at all."
4616	Mina@r@vmina0824."…Doremi-chan…"
4617	Doremi@r@vdoremi0809."Mina, you must really love Karin."
4618	Doremi@r@vdoremi0810."I think being hit with those harsh words from her must've been tough for you."
4619	Doremi@r@vdoremi0811."But don't torment Karin either."
4620	Doremi@r@vdoremi0812."Try to do it like me… and just be thankful to her for not making you feel that before, and being your best friend until today."
4621	Karin@r@vkarin0854."…Thankful…?"
4622	Doremi@r@vdoremi0813."For a terrible liar like you, to be friendly to Mina, even if you were just pretending."
4623	Doremi@r@vdoremi0814."I think you definitely ought to receive gratitude… for that effort."
4624	Karin@r@vkarin0855."………"
4625	Karin@r@vkarin0856."…I've got nothing to say."
4626	Karin@r@vkarin0857."Did some important wire in your brain just snap and get torn apart as you prepared yourself to die or what…?"
4627	Karin@r@vkarin0858."Fuuka. If we go along with Doremi any more, won't we just get dragged into this as well…?"
4628	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0797."…There's already no more time left at all."
4629	Karin@r@vkarin0859."Only you, as the other @b.@<Judge@>, can pull the torture lever."
4630	Karin@r@vkarin0860."So please get to it already. Time really is running out."
4631	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0798."………"
4632	Karin@r@vkarin0861."I already took on the dirty work. All that's left is your job, Fuuka."
4633	Mina@r@vmina0825."…F-Fuuka-chan…"
4634	Doremi@r@vdoremi0815.@z149."STOP RIGHT NOW, FUUKA! YOU CAN'T DO THIS, YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T!"
4635	@rDoremi hugs Fuuka tightly. No, clings to her.
4636	Doremi@r@vdoremi0816."This'll all be resolved if you pull my torture lever! You don't need to pull Mina's!"
4637	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0799."…But… Doremi, you know I can't make you the @b.@<Condemned@> again, myself."
4638	Karin@r@vkarin0862."I… wouldn't even joke about sacrificing you to save a worm like Mina, you get it?"
4639	Doremi@r@vdoremi0817."K… Karin…"
4640	Karin@r@vkarin0863."………"
4641	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0800."Th-there's no time…! The flames under us keep getting stronger…!"
4642	Karin@r@vkarin0864."I don't wanna die. So I want us to hurry up and decide on one sacrifice."
4643	Doremi@r@vdoremi0818.@z150."THAT'S WHY I NOMINATE MYSELF AS THE SACRIFICE!"
4644	Karin@r@vkarin0865."Is that your wish, Doremi?"
4645	Doremi@r@vdoremi0819."It is! No, that's not it, it's an order!"
4646	Doremi@r@vdoremi0820.@z150."RIGHT NOW, SAY NOT GUILTY ONE MORE TIME AND MAKE ME THE @b.@<CONDEMNED@> AGAIN!"
4647	Doremi@r@vdoremi0821."If you can't do that… I can get in the way of your own plans of survival…!"
4648	Karin@r@vkarin0866."………"
4649	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0801."There's no time, for real…!"
4650	Karin@r@vkarin0867."…Miiinaaa."
4651	Karin@r@vkarin0868."Doremi's saying she wants to die in your place."
4652	Karin@r@vkarin0869."So about that… do you have any comment to make?"
4653	Karin@r@vkarin0870."If you find it moving, maybe my own feelings will be stirred too…"
4654	Mina@r@vmina0826."…*hic*…"
4655	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0802."Karin…! This isn't the time…!"
4656	Karin@r@vkarin0871."If that's what you think then you should hurry up and pull Mina's torture lever already."
4657	Doremi@r@vdoremi0822.@z150."STOP IT!! THAT'S THE ONE THING I WON'T ALLOW!!"
4658	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0803."…*sob*…"
4659	Mina@r@vmina0827."………"
4660	@rThere is a stifling silence, and the heat.
4661	@rEven though they all want to say something, or perhaps have to say something.
4662	@r…It's an unpleasant silence, in which only a few groans slip out.
4663	Karin@r@vkarin0872."…Not guilty."
4664	@rOnce Karin has declared her not guilty, Doremi's body is dragged over into its own torture chair again, with a violent metallic sound.
4665	@rHer arms and legs are restrained but… even with sweat forming on her face, Doremi's expression is satisfied.
4666	Karin@r@vkarin0318."Guilty."
4667	Doremi@r@vdoremi0823."…This is fine. Thank you, Karin."
4668	Karin@r@vkarin0873."Jeez… I lost to you. It's my defeat."
4669	Mina@r@vmina0828."D-Doremi-chan…!"
4670	Karin@r@vkarin0874."Aren't you glad? That Doremi thinks of you as her best friend."
4671	Karin@r@vkarin0875."She said so earlier. So how 'bout you thank me too?"
4672	Karin@r@vkarin0876."Didn't I always, always keep up the charade that we were a group of four good frieends?"
4673	Mina@r@vmina0829."…K… Karin…!!"
4674	Karin@r@vkarin0877."Don't get too cocky, alright? You know I could make you the fucking @b.@<Condemned@> again in just one second, right?"
4675	Karin@r@vkarin0878."Hey you cunt, why don't you sit there for a little bit and look at Doremi taking your place?"
4676	Doremi@r@vdoremi0824."Mina! Don't give in to her goddamn provocation! Fuuka! There's no time left!! Hurry up and pull my goddamn torture lever!"
4677	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0804."D-Doremi…!!"
4678	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0805."…Sorry… …I'm really sorry…!"
4679	Mina@r@vmina0830."Doremi-chan…!!!"
4680	Doremi@r@vdoremi0825."Mina, thank you for everything…. And… forgive me for hurting you, even if I don't remember…!"
4681	Karin@r@vkarin0879."Hurry up and do it already, Fuuka!!!"
4682	@r…A bloodcurdling scream… reverberates around them.
4683	@rAlthough they can hear an eerie mechanical sound, that might remind you of the dentist… they can't tell what is happening to Doremi.
4684	@rHowever, both of her eyes are open wide as she gurgles and convulses… enduring some kind of horrific, excruciating torture…
4685	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0806."Sorry, Doremi… sorry, Doremi…!"
4686	Karin@r@vkarin0880."The screws in our collars can be turned! Now we can get them off!"
4687	@rThey can see the door to the escape elevator opening.
4688	@rFuuka and Mina both hurry to get their collars off.
4689	@rDoremi doesn't seem to be dead.
4690	@rBut, blood is bubbling up from the sides of her mouth, she is still occasionally convulsing, and it doesn't look good for her…
4691	Karin@r@vkarin0881."Okay, time to go! Thanks for that, Doremi."
4692	@rKarin, who got her collar off first, says this as a matter of fact and slowly walks towards the door of the escape elevator.
4693	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0807."I-I got it off…! You too, Mina-chan, hurry…!"
4694	Mina@r@vmina0831."Wait, wait… i-it's tight…"
4695	Karin@r@vkarin0882.——Not guilty.
4696	@rMina's body is once again dragged over into its torture chair.
4697	@rShe is able to evade the arm restraints, but the screw on her collar is once again tightly locked in place.
4698	Karin@r@vkarin0883."…Ahh. So I can still make verdicts."
4699	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0808."K-Karin?! What the hell are—"
4700	Mina@r@vmina0832."D-d-d-d,"
4701	Mina@r@vmina0833.@z138."DON'T FUCK WITH MEeEEEeEEEE!!! GET THIS OOOoOOOOOoOFF!!!"
4702	Karin@r@vkarin0884."I won't forgive you."
4703	Karin@r@vkarin0885."I don't have a big heart like Doremi does."
4704	Karin@r@vkarin0886."Not that I've emptied out all that shit about you all the way from the pit of my stomach… my bad but, I just don't wanna see your face ever again."
4705	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0809.@z132."I-ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW MURDER?! WHAT NEED IS THERE TO HAVE MINA-CHAN DIE TOO?!"
4706	Karin@r@vkarin0887."Alright, I guess I'll forgive ya. Not guilty."
4707	@rThe mechanism restraining Mina is released but… the remaining time is used up.
4708	@rPillars of fire pierce through the mesh floor and shoot up high.
4709	@rThey start from the corners and go around the room in a circle, surrounding it.
4710	Mina@r@vmina0834."Eek, eek?! S-save… me…"
4711	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0810.@z150."MINA-CHAN…!!"
4712	Karin@r@vkarin0888."…If you like her so much, why doncha go save her?"
4713	@rKarin whispers as the elevator door slowly closes.
4714	@rUpon her angry expression, Fuuka gulps down her spit… and hangs her head, speechless.
4715	Karin@r@vkarin0889."…See ya later. Byebye, Mina the Worm."
