4889	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0554.@z150."GYAAAaAAAAAAAAaAAAaaH-AaaH-aah…"
4890	@rFuuka's screams, as well as the infernal heat swallowing the entire room, are blocked off by the elevator door that has finally closed…

# 07_gameB後半02 (2nd half 02)
4891	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0573."Thank you, Doremi. Go to hell."
4892	@rThe flames of hell swallow everything.
4893	@rAnd amidst those flames, the two hold each other's shoulders, and even appear to be laughing.
4894	@rAnd the boy, being made to watch all of this, is swallowed as well, cage and all, into the inferno…

# 07_gameB後半03 (2nd half 03)
4895	Doremi@r@vdoremi0633.@z150."GHoOOOOOOoOOOOOOhHH!!!!"
4896	Doremi@r@vdoremi0634.@z138."HNNNNNNG-HNNNNNNNNGHHH!!! HNNNGuUUuUUUUU!!!"
4897	@rThe girls were not even permitted to plug their ears against those bloodcurdling screams of mortal agony.
4898	@rThere is a sound from the mechanisms in their own collars unlocking, like a screw coming loose at the base of their necks.
4899	@rThe vigor of the flames under the floor increases, this time enough to swallow the entire room.
4900	@rUnable to block Doremi's continued death screams… the girls frantically remove their own collars…
4901	Karin@r@vkarin0606."Shit, shit…! How many times do I have to turn it before it comes off…?!"
4902	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0580."It's hot, aaaaah!! It's hopeless, aaaaaah…!!"
4903	Mina@r@vmina0558."*Huff*, *huff*, *huff*… it's… hopeless…"
4904	Boy@r@vm_shou0025."………"
4905	Mina@r@vmina0559."…Sorry about that, little boy. …For making you watch something so cruel."
4906	Boy@r@vm_shou0026."………"
4907	Mina@r@vmina0560."For us girls, the cuteness is but appearances."
4908	Mina@r@vmina0561."When the mask is peeled back, we're just barf bags stuffed full of filthy, slippery, sticky vomit."
4909	Boy@r@vm_shou0027."………"
4910	Mina@r@vmina0562."Well, if you've had nice dreams about girls before, I guess you've learned a thing or two…"
4911	Mina@r@vmina0563.@z132."HAHAHA, A-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAa, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAaa…"
4912	@rThe girls are swallowed by the erupting pillars of fire, becoming writhing, fiery figures…

# 07_gameB後半04 (2nd half 04)
4913	@rThe columns of fire swallow the girls, and are about to swallow the boy's cage as well.
4914	Boy@r@vm_shou0028."………"
4915	@rThe boy, without a word… is swallowed into the flames that are now burning up the girls…

# 07_gameB後半05 (2nd half 05)
4916	Karin@r@vkarin0704."…Ugh… a…"
4917	@rKarin has made a fatal mistake.
4918	@rShe is the only one holding a weapon, Fuuka is only trying to escape from her… or so she thinks, but this is a fatal mistake.
4919	@rFuuka isn't running away.
4920	@rWhile pretending to back off… she is gaining length for the chain on her collar, and turning it into a chain whip…
4921	Karin@r@vkarin0705."Aaaaah… gha… gh…"
4922	@rKarin's rampage and Fuuka's full-force counterattack happen to coincide.
4923	@r…The chain whip violently strikes both of Karin's eyeballs… and crushes them.
4924	@rKarin covers her eyes with both hands and moans, stumbling around… and finally falls and tumbles over onto the burning mesh.
4925	@rHer skin and muscles becoming charred, and the odor of her burning hair, create a scene one wouldn't think possible in this world…
4926	Mina@r@vmina0604."…Fuuka-chan…"
4927	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0631."There's still… hope… Doremi!"
4928	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0632."If you just say ‘not guilty’ one more time and declare Karin guilty, we can all get out of here…!"
4929	@rOnly Doremi can make Karin the @b.@<Condemned@> again.
4930	@rFuuka can't pull Mina's torture lever but, at this point, her conscience might just forgive her for pulling Karin's…
4931	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0633."…Doremi! Doremi…!"
4932	@rShe starts lifting Doremi's face off the floor in order to get her up.
4933	@rBut the skin on her face was burned onto the red-hot mesh, and gives Fuuka the unsettling sensation that it is being ripped off…
4934	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0634."…No way…"
4935	Mina@r@vmina0605.@z150."N-NO, NO, NOoOOOOo…!!"
4936	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0635."Calm down, Mina-chan… I won't pull it…!"
4937	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0636."I won't pull the torture lever, no matter what!"
4938	Mina@r@vmina0606."…Fuuka-chan… b… but…"
4939	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0637."I'll stay just like this… and hold your hand."
4940	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0638."We'll always… be together… I'll keep my promise. …We'll always be close…"
4941	Mina@r@vmina0607."…Fuuka-chan… thank you…"
4942	Mina@r@vmina0608."…*sob*… *sob*…"
4943	@rThe remaining time reaches zero. …Pillars of fire erupt in sequence in the corners of the room.
4944	@rAlthough the elevator door is open… nothing can be done about the chains, there is nowhere to escape to.
4945	@r…Fuuka also apologizes to another person who is going to die here.
4946	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0639."Sorry about this… little boy. …I tried to save you, but there was nothing I could do…"
4947	Boy@r@vm_shou0029."………"
4948	@rAt last, the inferno swallows the entire room.
4949	@rThe elevator was forced open… but no one was able to get on it…

# 07_gameB後半06 (2nd half 06)
4950	Mina@r@vmina0638."Karin-chan!! Karin-chaaan!! Answer me, answer meeeee!! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaah!!"
4951	Doremi@r@vdoremi0689."…Mina! It seems like we can get the collars off now! Hurry, there's no time…!"
4952	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0689."………"
4953	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0690."Good night, Karin."
4954	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0691."Sora-kun, it would be nice if you could forgive her."
4955	@rFuuka's collar, which she has already taken off… falls out of her hand with a thud.

# 07_gameB後半07 (2nd half 07)
4956	Mina@r@vmina0690."…Karin-chan… I love you so much…"
4957	Boy@r@vm_shou0030."………"
4958	Mina@r@vmina0691."…I guess you're a boy so… you can't understand my feelings."
4959	Mina@r@vmina0692."If we could just have beaten each other up, and then made up with each other without keeping any grudges, like boys do… maybe that would have been better, you know…"
4960	Mina@r@vmina0693."…Living as a girl… is just the worst…"

# 07_gameB後半08 (2nd half 08)
4961	Karin@r@vkarin0772.@z147."HNGHHHHH, GHH, HNNGUUUUuUUUUUUUuUUUUU!!!"
4962	@rAfter gathering her resolve, Doremi quickly pulled the torture lever all the way down.
4963	@rAn eerie mechanical sound is accompanied by Karin's moans of anguish. …However, they can't quite tell from the outside what is happening to her body.
4964	@rA cold sweat rises on Karin's entire body, rolling off her in drops.
4965	@rThere's no doubt some kind of terrifying mechanism is inflicting some horrific torture on her, but they still can't tell exactly what it is…
4966	Mina@r@vmina0701."The collars! Just now, they made some kind of sound…!!"
4967	Doremi@r@vdoremi0726."We can get them off now!"
4968	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0754."The elevator door opened! Let's get the collars off, quickly!"
4969	Mina@r@vmina0702."…So we can't rescue that kid, huh…"
4970	Doremi@r@vdoremi0727."You think this is the time to worry about others…!"
4971	Boy@r@vm_shou0031."………"
4972	@rThe girls — after offering one of their friends as a sacrifice — remove their collars one by one and rush into the elevator.
4973	@rAt this point, pillars of fire erupt through the mesh of the floor.
4974	@rThe elevator door closes tantalizingly slowly.
4975	@rThe girls watch Karin, the sacrifice they offered, slowly being swallowed by the pillars of fire…
4976	@rA single trail of blood flows from the side of the sacrified girl's mouth… and she has an unexpectedly calm expression…
4977	Karin@r@vkarin0773."…Wait up…"
4978	Karin@r@vkarin0774."…Don't leave… me alone… in Hell…"
4979	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0755."………"
4980	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0756."It's alright, Karin."
4981	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0757."Since this elevator's destination is Hell, too."
4982	@rThe elevator door closes, and the violently erupting flames reach the ceiling, swallowing Karin entirely.
4983	@r…Her screams of mortal agony cannot be heard.

# 07_gameB後半09 (2nd half 09)
4984	Mina@r@vmina0735."Byebye, Karin-chaaan…"
4985	Mina@r@vmina0736.@z150."HA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA… GEEYAAAAaAaH-AH-AAAH-AAaAaH…"
4986	@rThe closing elevator door cuts off Mina boisterous laughter mixed with her screams of mortal agony…

# 07_gameB後半10 (2nd half 10)
4987	Boy@r@vm_shou0033."………"
4988	Doremi@r@vdoremi0749."…Mina and I. …Even though the two of us were close like no other…"
4989	Doremi@r@vdoremi0750."Just a tiny change to the roll of the dice… was enough for all this to happen to me…"
4990	Doremi@r@vdoremi0751."It's the same for Mina and Karin. …Every girl is… a kaleidoscope."
4991	Doremi@r@vdoremi0752."A kaleidoscope of so many different feelings and characteristics, all coexisting and blended together… something that boys could never understand…"
4992	@rThe girls' angry voices still can't quite be drowned out, even as they're swallowed by the flames rising higher…
4993	@rDoremi and the boy in the cage… gaze on at the others trading insults as they're burned…

# 07_gameB後半11 (2nd half 11)
4994	@rThe figures of Doremi and Mina scuffling with each other are swallowed into the erupting inferno, and disappear…
4995	Karin@r@vkarin0836."…Hahaha… hahahahahaha…"
4996	Karin@r@vkarin0837."Hey, kid. …This… must be Hell, right…?"
4997	Boy@r@vm_shou0034."………"
4998	Karin@r@vkarin0838."Hahaha, a-hahahahahahahahaha…!"
4999	Karin@r@vkarin0839.@z138."HAHAHAHAHAHA, GEEAAAaAAAAAAAAAaAAAAAH-AAAaAH…!!!"
5000	@rAs she watches the figures of the two girls still scuffling with each other… Karin is swallowed into the raging fires of hell…

# 07_gameB後半12 (2nd half 12)
5001	Mina@r@vmina0835.@z150."GYAAAAAaaAah… aAaH… aa… a…"
5002	@rMina's agonizing screams of death, and the heat from the flames of Hell, are cut off by the closing elevator door…
