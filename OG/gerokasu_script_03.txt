1256	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0142."O-ow… Someone… get this off me…"
1257	Karin@r@vkarin0159."Ghh… hng…!"
1258	Karin@r@vkarin0160."I can't do it… with only my bare hands…!"
1259	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0143.@z132."THEN LOOK FOR SOME KIND OF TOOL! WHAT ARE YOU ALL SPACING OUT FOR?! HURRY UP! LOOK FOR SOMETHING!!"
1260	Doremi@r@vdoremi0133."…Look for what…?"
1261	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0144.@z116."SOMETHING FOR THIS! THE COLLAR AND CHAIN!! ON ME!! A TOOL TO GET IT OFF ME, OBVIOUSLY!! DO YOU NOT GET IT?!"
1262	Mina@r@vmina0155."B-but, there's nothing to be found…"
1263	Doremi@r@vdoremi0134."…We already looked before, and we didn't find anything…"
1264	Doremi@r@vdoremi0135."And even if we did, it would've fallen down below through this mesh floor."
1265	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0145."Then, look below the mesh! There must be a key somewhere to get this off me!!"
1266	Doremi@r@vdoremi0136."…Our hands can't reach through this kind of mesh…. And besides, there's the flames…"
1267	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0146."Mina's hands should be able to reach through!! Hurry up and do it!"
1268	Mina@r@vmina0156."M-Mina caaan't! Mina can't put her hands into flames like these…!"
1269	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0147."Look, it's just like you see in the movies and stuff! A game to test if you can stick your hands through the flames for your friend's sake!"
1270	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0148.@z132."WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?! HAVEN'T I ALWAYS BEEN SO KIND TOWARDS YOU, AND TREATED YOU SO WELL?!"
1271	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0149.@z133."ISN'T NOW THE TIME TO RETURN THE FAVOR?! DO IT ALREADY, GET TO WORK!! LOOK FOR MY KEY!!"
1272	Mina@r@vmina0157."I-if I put my hands in a place like that, they'll get burned…"
1273	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0150."Your hands aren't good for anything except being soft and cute, so getting them a little burned should be no problem, right?!"
1274	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0151."When are those inept, useless, clumsy fingers ever going to be useful other than now!!"
1275	Mina@r@vmina0158."Eek… eek, M-Mina… Mina just can't…"
1276	Karin@r@vkarin0161."F-Fuuka, calm down… I'll look too."
1277	Doremi@r@vdoremi0137."………"
1278	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0152.@z127."YOU TOO DOREMI, STOP GAWKING AND START LOOKING!! ISN'T FREEING ME THE FIRST DAMN THING WE HAVE TO DO?!"
1279	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0153.@z122."UNLIKE YOU AIRHEADS, I'M THE MOST INTELLIGENT HERE!! I SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUICKLY FIND A WAY TO ESCAPE FROM THIS ROOM!!"
1280	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0154.@z132."SO THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS GET THIS OFF ME!! BETTER YET — GET IT THE HELL OFF ME, NOW!!"
1281	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0155.@z150."THIS IS OUR IMMEDIATE FIRST PRIORITY IF WE WANT EVERYBODY TO SURVIVE!!"
1282	Mina@r@vmina0159."M-Mina will look, she'll look for Fuuka-chan's key, don't get so mad at Minaaa…"
1283	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0156.@z127."STOP PROCRASTINATING, YOU GODDAMN HALFWIT!! THIS ISN'T THE FUCKING TIME FOR THAT CUTESY BULLSHIIT!!"
1284	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0157.@z132."AAH, GOD! IF ONLY I COULD LOOK AROUND, I'D FIGURE SOMETHING OUT QUICKLY! AAH, GOD, I JUST DON'T GET IT!!"
1285	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0158."Aah, that's it, I got it!! Who are the @b.@<Judges@>, again?!"
1286	Mina@r@vmina0160."…Eh?"
1287	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0159."If a @b.@<Judge@> declares the @b.@<Condemned@> not guilty, the @b.@<Condemned@> is switched with the @b.@<Joker@>, right?!"
1288	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0160."So if she declares me not guilty, I'll be free, and then I can have a look myself!!"
1289	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0161."I don't care who the @b.@<Joker@> is, but I'm definitely the smarter one so I'll be able to find something! Definitely!!"
1290	Karin@r@vkarin0162."…I'm, the @b.@<Joker@>."
1291	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0162."Then switch places with me, Karin!! I'm smarter than you! It's for the best!!"
1292	Karin@r@vkarin0163."F-Fuuka…"
1293	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0163.@z113."THERE'S NO TIME TO HESITATE!! AREN'T THE FLAMES AT OUR FEET GETTING STRONGER!! AT THIS RATE WE'RE GOING TO DIE, ALL OF US!!"
1294	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0164.@z108."@b.@<JUDGES@>!! MINA AND DOREMI, RIGHT?! HURRY, MAKE ME NOT GUILTY AND LET ME GO!! HURRY!! HURRYYYYyY!!"
1295	Mina@r@vmina0161."H-How could Mina…"
1296	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0165."I SAID TO HURRY THE HELL UP!! YOU'RE ALL DUMBER THAN ME SO IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE, YOU HAVE TO FREE ME FIRST!!!"
1297	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0166.@z140."HURRY, HURRY THE HELL UP, YOU INCOMPETENTS!! HURRY, HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY!!!"
1298	@rAbruptly… does the raving Fuuka become silent.
1299	@rThis silence rather startles Mina…
1300	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0167."…See, this is why… dealing with idiots is fucking unbeaarable."
1301	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0168."They're as dumb as bricks and can't understand a damn thing you tell them. …Honestly, dealing with them is so goddamn tiresome…"
1302	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0169."I don't get why… Mina?"
1303	Mina@r@vmina0162."…Huh? A-Ah…"
1304	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0170."Why an idiot like you gets to be free. I don't get it at all."
1305	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0171."Leaving me restrained here — when I'm the smartest and the one who can maximize our chances of escaping from this situation,"
1306	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0172."While the hopelessly stupid halfwit Mina is free. What reason even is there?"
1307	Mina@r@vmina0163."…Uu…　Mina doesn't know…"
1308	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0173."Karinnn. This cunt here doesn't get it. So you tell me!"
1309	Karin@r@vkarin0164."I… I don't…"
1310	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0174."Come to think of it, like, aren't you wayyy more of a hopeless idiot than me?"
1311	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0175."Hey, Karin… You wanna die in this insane death game? Do you wanna burn to death?"
1312	Karin@r@vkarin0165."…It's not like I want to die…"
1313	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0176.@z150."RIGHT?! THEN LET'S SURVIVE!! ALL OF US!!"
1314	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0177."I mean, I'm smart! I'm perceptive! So I'll certainly be way more useful than a hopeless idiot like you!"
1315	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0178."…Isn't it strange? Why should Mina and Karin be free when they're so much more stupid and useless than I am, while I'm the one who's restrained?"
1316	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0179."You need to realize! This is that kind of game!"
1317	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0180."It's the kind of game to determine if you guys have enough self-awareness to know what incompetent, hopeless idiots you are, and accept being the @b.@<Condemned@> in my stead."
1318	Karin@r@vkarin0166."………"
1319	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0181.@z150."I FUCKING TOLD YOU TO SIT HERE IN MY STEAD!!!!"
1320	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0182.@z150."YOU'RE THE @b.@<JOKER@>, ARE YOU NOT?! STOP PLAYING DUMB, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!"
1321	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0183."The point is, it's just a game about realizing which of us is smarter — that dumb cunt Karin or the intelligent Fuuka-sama here!!!"
1322	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0184."Mina, you bitch! Do you still not get it?! You're even more of a dumbass if you don't even know who's dumber between me and her!!!"
1323	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0185."Use that shitty, inadequate, tiny pea brain of yours to say ‘not guilty’ and release me right now!!"
1324	Mina@r@vmina0164."M-Mina can't… d-do that…"
1325	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0186."Mina-chan♪"
1326	Mina@r@vmina0165."…Eh?"
1327	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0187."Can you try saying ‘not guilty’?"
1328	Mina@r@vmina0166."…Uu…"
1329	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0188."Not guilty. N o t g u i l t y. N  o  t  g  u  i  l  t  y."
1330	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0189."N-o-t-g-u-i-l-t-y. Not-guil-ty."
1331	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0190."Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty—not guilty!"
1332	Mina@r@vmina0167."N-no good…. Mina… can't say it…"
1333	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0191.@z132."THEN FUCKING DIE, YOU HOPELESS IDIOT!! YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING MORON, YOU WALKING PILE OF DIARRHEA!!"
1334	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0192."Push that pissy face of yours into the burning mesh and apologize for being born, right the fuck now!!! Apologize!! Fucking apologize!!!"
1335	Doremi@r@vdoremi0138."………"
1336	Doremi@r@vdoremi0139."…Can you,"
1337	Doremi@r@vdoremi0140."Quiet down a little…?"
1338	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0193."…Huh?!"
1339	Doremi@r@vdoremi0141."Don't think… that everything in the world always revolves around what you want!!"

1340	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0194."Owowowow… *huff*, *huff*…"
1341	Karin@r@vkarin0167."Are you okay, Fuuka?! You're not hurt, are you?!"
1342	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0195."I got scratches in a few places but nevermind that."
1343	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0196."It won't matter to any of us here after the five minutes are over."
1344	Doremi@r@vdoremi0142."…So, what do we do?"
1345	Mina@r@vmina0168."W-we can't let Fuuka-chan die just to save the other three, we can't!"
1346	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0197."Everybody, please, can I get just a little bit of quiet time?"
1347	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0198."Let me analyze the situation a little…"
1348	Karin@r@vkarin0168."Th-that's just fine. You're the smartest one here, Fuuka, I'm sure you'll think of something!"
1349	Doremi@r@vdoremi0143."…Quiet."
1350	Mina@r@vmina0169."…Huff… huff…"
1351	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0199."What's the culprit's goal? It can only be one thing."
1352	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0200."That is, watching us struggle at the mercy of a death game."
1353	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0201."It's possible that… it's being displayed somewhere on some dark-web site in order to make money."
1354	Karin@r@vkarin0169."It must be. Everything about this tells me that must be it!"
1355	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0202."If that were the case… there's one unnecessary element."
1356	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0203."What role does that kid play?"
1357	Doremi@r@vdoremi0144."So if we go by usual movie tropes… that kid is the true culprit?"
1358	Mina@r@vmina0170."A kid this young, the culprit?! There's no way!"
1359	Boy@r@vm_shou0015."………"
1360	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0204."…His outward appearance certainly wouldn't suggest it."
1361	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0205."Maybe his face is a carefully detailed mask. And he doesn't talk because he can't change his voice to match."
1362	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0206."Even though he looks like a child, we have no way of knowing what his actual age is."
1363	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0207."And even if he is the age he appears to be, we don't know for sure that his intellect matches his age."
1364	Karin@r@vkarin0170."I-if you'd go that far… then we can't trust anything…"
1365	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0208."In any case… that kid's existence in this death game is peculiar."
1366	Doremi@r@vdoremi0145."…Indeed, he doesn't play any part in the rules of our death game."
1367	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0209."At first glance, you'd think that kid's cage was welded shut and that there's no way out of it."
1368	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0210."But, where did that kid's cage come from?"
1369	Mina@r@vmina0171."F-from the ceiling, and with a bang…"
1370	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0211."Right. Which means, just when time is about to run out, the opposite could happen. It could be pulled back up into the ceiling at that point."
1371	Karin@r@vkarin0171."Th-that's true…"
1372	Mina@r@vmina0172."But, doesn't the cage have no exit?! Isn't there no way out?!"
1373	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0212."It would appear that way at first glance, but there might be a mechanism to open it."
1374	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0213."Even if there isn't, it shouldn't be impossible to cut it open by burning through it, given enough time."
1375	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0214."In other words, what I'm trying to say is… that kid's cage is not there to prevent him from running away,"
1376	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0215."Rather, it must be a safe place… for him to admire our struggling up close…!"
1377	Karin@r@vkarin0172.@z150."I-IS THAT IT?! THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?! YOU'RE THE GODDAMN CULPRIT, AREN'T YOU?!"
1378	@rThe boy's hands, gripping the cage, are seized forcefully by Karin.
1379	@rThe boy's expression has contorted a little from the pain of the strong grip, but no words come out of him.
1380	Boy@r@vm_shou0016."………"
1381	Karin@r@vkarin0173.@z131."HEY, SAY SOMETHING, DAMMIT!! ARE YOU THE GODDAMN CULPRIT?! DO YOU HAVE THE KEYS TO GET THESE COLLARS OFF?!"
1382	Karin@r@vkarin0174."You must think you can just escape into the ceiling in this cage, but I won't let you…!!"
1383	Karin@r@vkarin0175."And if we're all gonna burn to death here anyway… I'll make goddamn sure we'll take you with us…!!"
1384	Boy@r@vm_shou0017."………"
1385	Mina@r@vmina0173."…Hey, i-is that kid really a bad person…?"
1386	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0216.@z109."HOW DON'T YOU GET THAT IF HE WEREN'T, THERE'S NO REASON HE SHOULD EVEN BE HERE!! SHUT UP, YOU INCOMPETENT SINGLE CELL ORGANISM!!"
1387	Mina@r@vmina0174."Ee-, eek! Mina's sorry, Mina's sorryyy…!!"
1388	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0217."Nice work, Karin! You've put your arm strength to good use for us!"
1389	Karin@r@vkarin0176."Yup, I've got your back! Even if we die, I'm not letting him go!!"
1390	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0218."That kid definitely has a key or something! You know, that's often what happens in variety shows, right?!"
1391	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0219."The person looking for the key doesn't realize it's been right under their nose all along. It feels like a dumb joke that would get all the comedians in the stands bursting into laughter!"
1392	Karin@r@vkarin0177."…You fucking sick bastard…!!"
1393	Karin@r@vkarin0178.@z150."JUST GIVE US THE KEY…! I'LL BREAK YOUR ARM RIGHT HERE IF YOU DON'T…!"
1394	Boy@r@vm_shou0018."………—"
1395	@rThe boy's expression twists in pain and he lets out long, painful breaths but, regardless, no words have come out of him at any point.
1396	@rMina has the uneasy feeling that there's no way one of the culprit's people would put themselves in that position…
1397	Doremi@r@vdoremi0146."Wait, Fuuka, Karin."
1398	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0220."What…?"
1399	Doremi@r@vdoremi0147."There's no conclusive evidence that this kid is actually on the culprit's side."
1400	Doremi@r@vdoremi0148."And there's always the possibility that he's a victim of another death game."
1401	Mina@r@vmina0175."Th-that's right! If he can't talk, there might be some reason for that!"
1402	Mina@r@vmina0176."Maybe they threatened him like, ‘if you give them a hint or anything, it's game over for you!’"
1403	Karin@r@vkarin0179."…Um,"
1404	Karin@r@vkarin0180."Wh-whaddya think… Fuuka…?"
1405	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0221."What are you saying, Doremi? Why are you standing up for the culprit?"
1406	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0222."Right now, we're wasting what little time we have left, so don't you think we should get this kid to spit it out before it's time for us to die?!"
1407	Doremi@r@vdoremi0149."And what if that was a misconception on your part to begin with, Fuuka?"
1408	Doremi@r@vdoremi0150."If that's the case, we'll be wasting the chance for at least three of us to survive, and all of us will die in vain."
1409	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0223."The option to let me die just to save yourself was never out of the question for you, was it?!?!"
1410	Doremi@r@vdoremi0151."Fuuka, you don't want to be left behind, so what you're doing is skillfully diverting the topic away from the death game at hand."
1411	Doremi@r@vdoremi0152."And I won't deny that that's the best effort you can make to get the ideal outcome for yourself."
1412	Doremi@r@vdoremi0153."So try not to blame us for trying to get the ideal outcome for ourselves. Don't get in our way."
1413	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0224.@z166."HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!"
1414	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0225.@z150."KARIN!! MINA!! IT'S HER, IT'S HER!! DOREMI IS THE CULPRIT!!"
1415	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0226.@z150."I FOUND HER OUT SO NOW SHE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU!! DON'T LISTEN TO HER!!"
1416	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0227.@z115."I'M RIGHT!! THE ONE IN THE CAGE IS THE CULPRIT! AND DOREMI IS THE CULPRIT'S ACCOMPLICE!! DON'T LISTEN TO A SINGLE WORD SHE SAYYYYYS!!"
1417	Doremi@r@vdoremi0154.@z172."SHUT YOUR MOUTH!!!"
1418	@rWith a voice louder than anyone has ever heard from her, Doremi scares the words even out of Fuuka…
1419	Doremi@r@vdoremi0155.@z150."DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING TO GO YOUR WAY EVERY TIME!!"

# 03_gameA_03（死：風、ピ：土）土麗美属性 (Condemned Fuuka, Joker Doremi: Doremi is chosen)
1420	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0228."…Ugh… *cough*, *cough*—"
1421	Karin@r@vkarin0181."Fuuka! Are you okay?! W-wait, of course you wouldn't be okay…"
1422	Karin@r@vkarin0182."Shit… it's too tough…. I can't get it off!"
1423	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0229."If you could get it off that easily, it would only be a sick joke…"
1424	Doremi@r@vdoremi0156."Yup…. The culprit is able to set up these kinds of devices just for this."
1425	Doremi@r@vdoremi0157."Fuuka, the restraints on your chair, and these collars… are obviously not going to come off so easily……"
1426	Mina@r@vmina0177."I-if we can't get them off, what do we do?!"
1427	Karin@r@vkarin0183."I guess the four of us are now a group of grilled steak…"
1428	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0230."It's a little early to give up just yet. It isn't too late to resist a little more."
1429	Karin@r@vkarin0184."Right?! Isn't there something we can use as a tool?! If we can use it like a lever, then surely…!"
1430	Mina@r@vmina0178."M-Mina will look around, tooo…! There must be something, there must be somethiiing…!"
1431	Doremi@r@vdoremi0158."…I agree it's too early to give just yet but, everyone, please be mindful of how much time is left."
1432	Doremi@r@vdoremi0159."Even once we arrive at a final decision… it will still take some time to carry out."
1433	Karin@r@vkarin0185."Huh? What final decision?!"
1434	Doremi@r@vdoremi0160."How to get as many of us out of here."
1435	Mina@r@vmina0179."…Doremi-chan, you mean…"
1436	Mina@r@vmina0180."Abandoning Fuuka-chan…?!"
1437	Karin@r@vkarin0186.@z150."F-, F-F-, FUCK THAT!!! ABANDON FUUKA?!"
1438	Doremi@r@vdoremi0161."…If we can't find a way out of here in the next four minutes, we'll have to decide whether to die together, or not."
1439	Doremi@r@vdoremi0162."And don't tell me the four of us should become grilled steak together as friends or something…"
1440	Karin@r@vkarin0187."D-damn, just how heartless are you…?! Even back then, there have been times,"
1441	Mina@r@vmina0181.@z150."STOP IT! THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAAT!"
1442	Mina@r@vmina0182.@z123."AND BESIDES! THINK OF FUUKA-CHAN! SHE'S DESPERATELY WRACKING HER BRAINS RIGHT NOW! SO PLEASE, BE QUIET FOR NOW!!"
1443	Karin@r@vkarin0188."Th-that's right…. Fuuka is the smartest one here!"
1444	Karin@r@vkarin0189."I'm counting on you, Fuuka…! Think of smething for us…!"
1445	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0231."………"
1446	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0232."…It might be worth a try."
1447	Mina@r@vmina0183."What?! Did Fuuka-chan think of something?!"
1448	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0233."Umm, well… there is something I'd like to try just once."
1449	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0234."For it to work, I need the cooperation of everybody here."
1450	Karin@r@vkarin0190."Whatever it is, just say it! We can't waste any time right now!"
1451	Doremi@r@vdoremi0163."The cooperation of everybody here, you mean…?"
1452	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0235."A way to escape from this room the culprit set up."
1453	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0236."Namely, by declaring the @b.@<Condemned@> guilty and pulling the torture lever."
1454	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0237."If we do that, everyone except the @b.@<Condemned@> can take their collars off, and the door to the escape elevator will open…"
1455	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0238."That's the only way. In particular, we don't know for sure that the @b.@<Condemned@> will necessarily die or anything like that."
1456	Karin@r@vkarin0191."But how the hell is the @b.@<Condemned@> supposed to escape if she's still bound to her chair?!"
1457	Mina@r@vmina0184."Even if the torture weren't that bad… she would still get burned to death in the end!"
1458	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0239."Right. Ultimately, she'd still die…. But that's not necessary for getting the collars off and opening the elevator door."
1459	Doremi@r@vdoremi0164."…I don't understand what you're saying."
1460	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0240."What if… no one were sitting in the torture chair at the time its torture lever is pulled?"
1461	Karin@r@vkarin0192."Eh…?"
1462	Mina@r@vmina0185."But, but! Fuuka-chan, aren't your arms and legs still bound to that chair?!"
1463	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0241."Earlier, when this death game started, I was @b.@<Condemned@>, so I was dragged over into the torture chair."
1464	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0242."Once the sacrifice has been dragged into this chair, the mechanism to restrain her arms and legs is activated. But,"
1465	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0243."What if the @b.@<Condemned@> isn't dragged over…?"
1466	Karin@r@vkarin0193."O-oh right, so that's it…! But, how the heck…"
1467	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0244."First, the @b.@<Joker@> has to tightly secure the chain on her own neck."
1468	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0245."I think that hanging cage will probably be good for that."
1469	Doremi@r@vdoremi0165."…Don't tell me you actually think that would protect her from being dragged into the torture chair?!"
1470	Doremi@r@vdoremi0166.@z131."AND EVEN IF THAT WENT EXACTLY AS PLANNED, THERE'S STILL NO GUARANTEE YOU COULD PULL THE TORTURE LEVER!"
1471	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0246."…Yeah. That's why I want to give it a try."
1472	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0247."If the torture lever is pulled, the collars come off and the elevator door opens."
1473	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0248."But if the @b.@<Condemned@> isn't in the torture chair at that point… whatever kind of torture it's supposed to be, it won't matter!"
1474	Doremi@r@vdoremi0167."As if something so convenient would just work! With a culprit who'd go to such lengths to set up such a grand stage just for this?!"
1475	Doremi@r@vdoremi0168."The torture lever obviously won't work until after the @b.@<Condemned@> is restrained!"
1476	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0249."But that's why I want to try!"
1477	Mina@r@vmina0186."If we try… and it goes well, it will be a lucky miracle!"
1478	Karin@r@vkarin0194."It's worth a shot…!"
1479	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0250."The @b.@<Joker@> is you, right, Doremi? I beg of you, lend us your strength—"
1480	Doremi@r@vdoremi0169.@z150."NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT!!"
1481	Doremi@r@vdoremi0170.@z172."I CAN'T COOPERATE WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT!"
1482	Karin@r@vkarin0195."Why not?! There's no guarantee it will go well, but it's worth a try, isn't it!"
1483	Doremi@r@vdoremi0171."And then, when it fails, who will be @b.@<Condemned@>?! It'll be me, won't it!"
1484	Doremi@r@vdoremi0172."You're just trying to weasel your way out of being @b.@<Condemned@> and waste time while you pretend to look for some other scheme, Fuuka."
1485	Doremi@r@vdoremi0173."And then, at the last moment, you'll reluctantly decide to make the @b.@<Condemned@>, that is, me, your sacrifice!"
1486	Doremi@r@vdoremi0174.@z132."I KNOW ABOUT YOUR MALICIOUS INTENT, FUUKA! NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CAN'T FOOL ME!!"
1487	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0251."Wh-why would you think I'd fool you?"
1488	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0252."And besides, if we try it and it doesn't work, you can just make me @b.@<Condemned@> again!"
1489	Doremi@r@vdoremi0175."I can't trust you! Isn't there only one @b.@<Judge@> who can make a guilty verdict?"
1490	Doremi@r@vdoremi0176."What if that @b.@<Judge@>, after declaring me guilty… were to find herself in a state where she can't make any more verdicts?"
1491	Doremi@r@vdoremi0177."If that were to happen, I'd be stuck as the @b.@<Condemned@>!"
1492	Karin@r@vkarin0196."What do you mean by that?! Are you saying Fuuka will come attack me or Mina because we're the @b.@<Judges@>?!"
1493	Mina@r@vmina0187."Mina doesn't think Fuuka-chan would… do something like that…"
1494	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0253."Doremi! I have no intention of deceiving you!"
1495	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0254."I'm begging you, let me try it anyway! We don't have much time!!"
1496	Doremi@r@vdoremi0178.@z150."NO! NO WAY!! LIKE HELL I COULD EVER TRUST YOU!!"
1497	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0255."Why won't you trust me?! Have I ever lied to you, Doremi?!"
1498	Doremi@r@vdoremi0179.@z150."IT'S SO OBVIOUS!! I KNOW ALL ABOUT HOW YOU REALLY FEEL!!"
1499	Karin@r@vkarin0197."Cut it out already, this isn't the time for this crap!! You chill out too, Doremi…!!"
1500	Mina@r@vmina0188.——Not guilty.
1501	@rDoremi's body is dragged over into the torture chair with terrifying force.
1502	@rHer breath choked out of her, her arms and legs are immediately restrained by the mysterious mechanism…
1503	Karin@r@vkarin0198."…Eh… Eh…?!"
1504	Doremi@r@vdoremi0180."*cough*-*cough* *cough*… ugh…"
1505	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0256."Wh-what's the meaning of this? D-did somebody say not guilty just now…?!"
1506	Mina@r@vmina0189."Even though Fuuka-chan says time is short, Doremi-chan sure is drawing this out…. It won't get solved like this."
1507	Mina@r@vmina0190."If Doremi-chan won't cooperate as the @b.@<Joker@>, Fuuka-chan should try being the @b.@<Joker@> instead."
1508	Mina@r@vmina0191."Right? Now it doesn't matter; Doremi-chan's cooperation isn't even neeeded… ahahahaha."
1509	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0257."Th-that may be so, but…"
1510	Doremi@r@vdoremi0181."Mina…. Wh-why…?"
1511	Mina@r@vmina0192."………"
1512	Mina@r@vmina0193."Whatcha making that ‘Why'd you betray me’ face for…?"

1513	Karin@r@vkarin0199."Is this for real, is this for real…? Stop fuck… sto…"
1514	Mina@r@vmina0194."Is Karin-chan okay?! Is she okayy?!"
1515	Karin@r@vkarin0200."Hmf- nkhhhhhh, nghhhhhh!!!"
1516	@rKarin tries to get out of the arm and leg restraints with all the strength her body can muster, but they won't budge…
1517	Karin@r@vkarin0201."I-it's no use… shit…"
1518	Karin@r@vkarin0202."Am I gonna die? Am I just gonna die… sitting in this ominous chair?"
1519	Mina@r@vmina0195.@z150."I DON'T WANT THAT!! KARIN-CHAN CAN'T JUST DIE, NOOO!!"
1520	Mina@r@vmina0196.@z138."WH-WHY IS KARIN-CHAN @b.@<CONDEMNED@>?! HOW COME? HOW COOOME?!"
1521	Mina@r@vmina0197."Of all the… how come… how come Karin-chan… WAAAAAH!!"
1522	Karin@r@vkarin0203."…Well… I guess my luck ran out."
1523	Karin@r@vkarin0204."There's not much I can do… hahahahaha."
1524	Mina@r@vmina0198.@z150."KARIN-CHAN, KARIN-CHAN!! NO NOoo, WAAAaAAAAaAaaaaH!!"
1525	Doremi@r@vdoremi0182."………"
1526	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0258."In any case, we should look around, everyone! Look for something that can get us all out of here alive!"
1527	Mina@r@vmina0199."Th-that's right… There's no time to cry, is there."
1528	Mina@r@vmina0200."Mina will look too…! Is there anything, is there anything—"
1529	Doremi@r@vdoremi0183."………"
1530	Karin@r@vkarin0205."…Haa, hahahahaha. …I can't go along with this…"
1531	Karin@r@vkarin0206."If you've done all you can, then it's about time to give up…. I just got the short end of the stick, I guees…"
1532	Karin@r@vkarin0207."All I can do… is sit here is complain."
1533	Karin@r@vkarin0208."…It's not like I can just… go along with something like…"
1534	Doremi@r@vdoremi0184."…You certainly do have a point."
1535	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0259."Eh?"
1536	Doremi@r@vdoremi0185."Needless to say, we'll hope for the best, but our chances of all of us escaping from here in just a few minutes are slim."
1537	Doremi@r@vdoremi0186."…In the end, we'll probably have to make a horrible decision so at least three of us will survive."
1538	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0260."Not even one minute has passed since we started looking, and you're already saying that?!"
1539	Doremi@r@vdoremi0187."To be precise, there's only a few minutes left, Fuuka."
1540	Doremi@r@vdoremi0188."Of course, there's no reason to stop looking. But hear me out, everyone. For Karin's sake."
1541	Karin@r@vkarin0209."Me? Wh-what's this about…"
1542	Doremi@r@vdoremi0189."The moment of truth will arrive soon, and when it does… we will have to accept sacrificing the @b.@<Condemned@>."
1543	Mina@r@vmina0201."No, Karin-chan can't be the sacrifice, absolutely not…!!"
1544	Karin@r@vkarin0210."…Of course, I don't wanna die either, y'know…?"
1545	Karin@r@vkarin0211."But… if it actually gets to the very, very end, and there's nothing we can do… pull my torture lever for me."
1546	Karin@r@vkarin0212."If my unchangeable fate is to die no matter what we do… then, like, the result where at least everyone else survives is better, obviously…"
1547	Doremi@r@vdoremi0190."If you're convinced there's no other way, right?"
1548	Karin@r@vkarin0213."I mean, of course, but…"
1549	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0261."…What are you getting at, Doremi?"
1550	Doremi@r@vdoremi0191."I'd like to give Karin some time to agree on it, too."
1551	Doremi@r@vdoremi0192."In other words, I'd like to grant Karin some time to make an effort to survive."
1552	Doremi@r@vdoremi0193."Karin should also have the right to look around and struggle to survive too, just like you're doing right now, Fuuka."
1553	Karin@r@vkarin0214."Well now, of course if you'd do that for me I'll be glad…!!"
1554	Karin@r@vkarin0215."If I'm gonna die anyway, I'd like a little time to struggle, too! And then once I've struggled thoroughly and realized nothing can be done…"
1555	Karin@r@vkarin0216."I could agree that my fate has nothing in store for me except death. …I can accept it."
1556	Mina@r@vmina0202."Th-that's right. Give Karin-chan a chance, tooo."
1557	Mina@r@vmina0203."Karin-chan is strong! Maybe there's something she can do with that strength of hers…!"
1558	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0262."I'm against it."
1559	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0263."Wasn't the very first thing we figured out as soon as we started searching that even with brute force, nothing can be done about these collars and chains?!"
1560	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0264."I do understand why you're saying you want to give Karin some time, too! But can we be calm about this?!"
1561	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0265."This is going to sound a little arrogant, okay? I'm the smartest one here!"
1562	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0266."Giving Karin some time means making the @b.@<Joker@>, that is, me, become @b.@<Condemned@> and restrained!"
1563	Doremi@r@vdoremi0194."Your strong suit is your smarts. Right, Fuuka? If that's the case, it should be no problem if you're sitting down."
1564	Mina@r@vmina0204."Uhh, umm… not guilty…!"
1565	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0267."Eh?!"
1566	@rThe instant the @b.@<Judge@>, Mina, made the not guilty verdict, the @b.@<Condemned@> and the @b.@<Joker@> switched places.
1567	@rAt that instant, Fuuka became the @b.@<Condemned@>. She was dragged into the torture chair prepared for her with force like a vice, and her arms and legs were restrained.
1568	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0268."*cough* ngg-khh…"
1569	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0269.@z147."MINAAA!! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN… DON'T FUCK WI— *cough*…"
1570	Mina@r@vmina0205."S-sorry… Mina wanted to give Karin-chan a chance too… I just…"
1571	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0270.@z150."YOU JUST WHAT?!? DON'T GIVE ME THAT CRAP!!"
1572	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0271."You know what you just did?! That was the same as killing the smartest one here, the person most capable of helping us escape from here!!"
1573	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0272."Free time for Karin's self-satisfaction?! Don't do stupid shit like that for such an utterly incomprehensible reason!!"
1574	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0273.@z119."ARE YOU AN IDIOT? YOU WANNA DIE? IF YOU WANNA DIE SO BAD THEN JUST FUCKING DIE ALONE!! ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING, MINA?! HUHH?!"
1575	Doremi@r@vdoremi0195."Shut your mouth."
1576	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0274.@z150."HUHh?!"
1577	Doremi@r@vdoremi0196.@z132."I TOLD YOU TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH!! DON'T THINK EVERYTHING REVOLVES AROUND YOU, FUUKA!!"
1578	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0275."………"
1579	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0276."…D-Doremi…?"
1580	@rFuuka, who was shouting with so much aggravation just a second ago… is rendered speechless by Doremi's glare.
1581	@rMaybe Karin or Mina could have such a dramatic change in temperament… or even Fuuka, who normally never gets agitated…
1582	@r…But to hear such words from her best friend, whom she believed she could confide anything in… she can't help but be dumbfounded…

1583	Karin@r@vkarin0217."A… am I, gonna die…?"
1584	Karin@r@vkarin0218."Like, like, the @b.@<Condemned@>… won't get saved, right…?"
1585	Doremi@r@vdoremi0197."…Either the @b.@<Condemned@> or the @b.@<Joker@> won't be saved…"
1586	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0277."…The @b.@<Joker@> is you, Mina-chan, isn't it?"
1587	Mina@r@vmina0206.@z150."B-BUT MINA DOESN'T LIKE IT! MINA DOESN'T WANT TO DIEE!!"
1588	Doremi@r@vdoremi0198."…Calm down. No one said they were going to let you die, Mina."
1589	Karin@r@vkarin0219."Well then… I guess letting me die is pretty damn well decided… haha…"
1590	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0278."You calm down too, Karin. Let's think about this. So we can all get out of here!"
1591	Doremi@r@vdoremi0199."…Let's just forget about the culprit's rules."
1592	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0279."Yeah. If we obey rules like those, none of us will be saved in the end."
1593	Mina@r@vmina0207."If only the elevator door could… be opened somehow…"
1594	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0280."It's shut pretty tightly…. My fingers can't get in there, but if I had some kind of tool…"
1595	Karin@r@vkarin0220."…We do. …Over there, you see?"
1596	@rKarin, still bound to the torture chair, is unable to point with her finger, but she still succeeds in getting the message across…
1597	Karin@r@vkarin0221."It looks like there's a thin pipe… in that corner over there, see? Can you get ahold of that?"
1598	Doremi@r@vdoremi0200."…This? It's certainly creaky, but… can we break it off…"
1599	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0281."If everybody pulls with all their strength, maybe somehow…"
1600	Karin@r@vkarin0222."That's it! Maybe it can be used as a tool, like a lever!"
1601	Mina@r@vmina0208."I-if it's decided then we better hurry! Hnng—"
1602	Doremi@r@vdoremi0201."…Alone, there's no chance. Let's try together, everyone."
1603	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0282."Let's combine our strengths. Reaaaady, set…!!"

1607	Doremi@r@vdoremi0202."I'm feeling some kind of movement in the pipe, but…"
1608	Karin@r@vkarin0224."…There's only one way…!"
1609	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0283."What is it…?!"
1610	Karin@r@vkarin0225."…That is, I want you to trust me, especially you, Mina…"
1611	Mina@r@vmina0211."W-what do you mean…?"
1612	Karin@r@vkarin0226."I'm pretty sure you're the @b.@<Joker@>, right, Mina? I want a @b.@<Judge@> to declare me not guilty so you can switch places with me, Mina."
1613	Mina@r@vmina0212.@z150."N-NO WAY, WHY WOULD MINA…?!"
1614	Karin@r@vkarin0227."But Mina, you have the least arm strength here, and I have the most, so if you switch places with me, we'll definitely be able to get it out!"
1615	Karin@r@vkarin0228."And then, we can use it as a lever to force the elevator open!"
1616	Mina@r@vmina0213.@z150."AND WHAT HAPPENS TO MINA?!"
1617	Karin@r@vkarin0229."I won't let you die or anything! Just like the elevator, I'll use it to get the collar off you just like with the others!"
1618	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0284."…Even if it works on the elevator, will it work on these collars?"
1619	Karin@r@vkarin0230."Only one way to find out!! If nothing works on the collars then, at that point,"
1620	Karin@r@vkarin0231."The @b.@<Judge@> can make a not guilty verdict again. If she does that, I'll be @b.@<Condemned@> again, and Mina gets released."
1621	Doremi@r@vdoremi0203."…But then, Karin, you'll…"
1622	Karin@r@vkarin0232."When the time comes. I want you to pull my torture lever and not hold back."
1623	Karin@r@vkarin0233."After all, he only said the brink of death, and its agony! He didn't said I'd die!"
1624	Karin@r@vkarin0234."So if you're on board…. My body is the strongest out of everyone here, so there should be a chance, shouldn't there…?"
1625	Mina@r@vmina0214."…Karin-chan…"
1626	Karin@r@vkarin0235."Doing what the culprit says is frustrating but everyone except me can get their collars off."
1627	Karin@r@vkarin0236."And then, like… I want you all to hurry out of here and look for help so you can save me somehow."
1628	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0285."Is that really… okay with you…?"
1629	Karin@r@vkarin0237."The one who has to accept this role is me, I guess. So like, if you think I'm trying to trick you, can you just do me in already…?"
1630	Karin@r@vkarin0238."I'm counting on on you! Time is short, just trust me!"
1631	Doremi@r@vdoremi0204."…If Mina's okay with it… it's worth a try."
1632	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0286."………"

1635	Karin@r@vkarin0239."Thank you for trusting me, Mina!"
1636	Karin@r@vkarin0240."You might get dragged over like I was, so I think you should sit in your chair beforehand…"
1637	Mina@r@vmina0217."M-Mina understands…. Mina's scared… Mina's scared…"
1638	Karin@r@vkarin0241."We're wasting time. Fuuka and Doremi, aren't you the @b.@<Judges@>? I'm counting on you!"

1690	Karin@r@vkarin0258."I just had the gut feeling that we'd better give up and resolve ourselves."
1691	Doremi@r@vdoremi0213."What do you mean by resolve…"
1692	Karin@r@vkarin0259."That we can't do anything but accept this death game and face it head on. That kind of resolve……"
1693	Mina@r@vmina0226."Mina doesn't understand what that meaans!! What do we have to acceept?!"
1694	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0306."…Exactly what it sounds like… I guess."

1701	Karin@r@vkarin0260."I don't want you to misunderstand me. As soon as the culprit told us this is a death game, I resolved myself."

1718	Karin@r@vkarin0271."I'm serious…"
1719	Karin@r@vkarin0272."Even if, say, we somehow survived the death game in this room… there might just be another death game waiting for us in the next room."
1720	Karin@r@vkarin0273."If that happened, and I ended up being the sacrifice, I'd accept my role to save everyone else…"
1721	Karin@r@vkarin0274."I wouldn't hesitate. I'd just take it, I'd accept it."
1722	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0310."…So, what you're really saying is that other people should do the same and just accept it, right…?"
1723	Doremi@r@vdoremi0218."…The cards that decided our fates were handed out randomly."
1724	Karin@r@vkarin0275."The kid in that cage handed them out without thinking about it."

1736	Karin@r@vkarin0277."But there's not much time left. So, Mina, I want you to use that time to sort out your feelings and accept it……"

1767	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0320."Oh, you're right! Even if our words don't get through to him, maybe he can still give us some clue."
1768	Karin@r@vkarin0288."I wonder…. I'm not even sure he knows Japanese."
1769	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0321."That's fine, just talk to him!"

1777	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0324."Maybe something terrible happened to him… and he closed off his mind from the outside world…"
1778	Karin@r@vkarin0289."Come on, little boy. Can you understand what I'm saying?"

1797	Doremi@r@vdoremi0232."Wh-what does that mean…?"
1798	Mina@r@vmina0252."It means… there's no way for the @b.@<Condemned@> to survive, right…?"
1799	Mina@r@vmina0253."But the @b.@<Condemned@> does have a choice."
1800	Mina@r@vmina0254."That is, either take everyone down with her… or accept her own fate… and let her friends survive."
1801	Karin@r@vkarin0298."…Mi… Mina…"
1802	Mina@r@vmina0255."If all Mina can do is die no matter how much she struggles… she'd like for everyone else to survive…"
1803	Mina@r@vmina0256."Of course… even Mina doesn't want to die."
1804	Mina@r@vmina0257."But, there's no way to save Mina, and there's no other way to leave this room besides letting Mina die… none at all."
1805	Mina@r@vmina0258."Mina understood when she saw everyone searching the room from over here."
1806	Mina@r@vmina0259."This death game is… just a simple game about deciding whether or not to let the @b.@<Condemned@> die…"
1807	Mina@r@vmina0260."So… Mina doesn't want everyone to waste any more time searching around for her own sake, when it won't accomplish anything…"
1808	Doremi@r@vdoremi0233."How can you say that…? Letting you… die…?,"
1809	Mina@r@vmina0261."Doremi-chan… that's the only way Mina can save everyone else…"
1810	Doremi@r@vdoremi0234."But… surviving by… sacrificing you, Mina…? *sob*…!!"
1811	Mina@r@vmina0262."Mina has already resolved herself."
1812	Mina@r@vmina0263."So, Mina is begging… everyone except her to escape this room in one piece… at least do that much for her…"
1813	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0327."Mina-chan…"
1814	Karin@r@vkarin0299."…Thank you, Mina, really."
1815	Karin@r@vkarin0300."I won't let that determination… go to waste."
1816	Karin@r@vkarin0301."We, and actually you too, Mina… only had two choices from the start."
1817	Karin@r@vkarin0302."Do we all die…? Or do we accept you as our sacrifice, Mina?"
1818	Karin@r@vkarin0303."Everyone vaguely realized… that the second choice was the best, but no one was able to say it out loud."
1819	Karin@r@vkarin0304."But… you said it for us, with your own words…. With nothing but the ultimate courage."
1820	Doremi@r@vdoremi0235."…*sob*"
1821	Mina@r@vmina0264."This choice is the one and only best case scenario…. Everyone understands. Mina understands too."
1822	Mina@r@vmina0265."So… before Mina's resolve starts to waver…"
1823	Karin@r@vkarin0305."You're right…. It's like you said, Mina."
1824	Karin@r@vkarin0306."We'll use your resolve… and leave this room alive."
1825	Karin@r@vkarin0307."The death game might continue after this. But, if we combine our strength, I'm sure we can do something!"
1826	Karin@r@vkarin0308."Fuuka has wisdom, and Doremi has composure. And I have power and reflexes, and my fury, on my side!"
1827	Karin@r@vkarin0309."We'll absolutely leave here alive, and we'll beat the crap out of that culprit bastard in your place, Mina, I promise!!"

1833	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0329."You're disgusting, Karin."
1834	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0330."What are you doing, steering this conversation into sacrificing Mina-chan?"
1835	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0331."It's just disgusting…. You waited for the weak-willed Mina-chan to say out loud that she'll be the sacrifice,"
1836	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0332."And then, you praised her for her courage as if that was the end of it. …Karin, you seriously make me wanna puke."
1837	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0333."Aren't you the @b.@<Joker@>? You're behaving as if there isn't even the tiniest chance you'll be @b.@<Condemned@> yourself."

1841	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0336."Oops, sorry if this was a bad time to snap like this. But I suppose I had no other choice but to snap."
1842	Mina@r@vmina0267."…F… Fuuka-chan…?"
1843	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0337."With that out of the way. Karin, you're the only one… I don't want to hear that word from."

1878	Karin@r@vkarin0315."We've gotta decide, between Mina and Doremi, who we're gonna save and who we're gonna let die… so we can survive."
1879	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0344."So you mean, wh… which one to trust… and which one to abandon…?!"
1880	Mina@r@vmina0284."Doremi-chan is the real culprit!! I have proof!!"
1881	Doremi@r@vdoremi0245."No you don't!! You're the actual culprit!! And you pinning false accusations on me is proof enough of that…!!"
1882	Karin@r@vkarin0316."…Doremi, how would there be any proof that Mina is the culprit?"
1883	Doremi@r@vdoremi0246.@z138."MINA SPEWING SUCH INCOMPREHENSIBLE NONSENSE IS PROOF SHE'S THE CULPRIT!!"
1884	Karin@r@vkarin0317."…Mina, what's your proof that Doremi is the culprit?"
1885	Mina@r@vmina0285."One look is enough to understand it."
1886	Mina@r@vmina0286."The room the elevator goes up to. That's the room Doremi-chan used for setting up this death game."
1887	Mina@r@vmina0287."One look is more than enough to understand that Doremi-chan is the culprit…!!"
1888	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0345."…H… how could…"
1889	Doremi@r@vdoremi0247.@z150."MINA, YOU CUNT!! I'LL KILL YOU!! I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!!!"
1890	Karin@r@vkarin0318.——Guilty.
1891	@rWhen Karin makes this verdict… some kind of mechanism in the torture chair Mina is sitting in gets activated.
1892	@rWhen this happens… the torture lever underneath it reveals itself.
1893	Mina@r@vmina0288."…Eh?"
1894	Mina@r@vmina0289."H-how come you won't believe me…? K-Karin-chan…?"
1895	Mina@r@vmina0290."Karin-chan, how come… you won't… believe… me…"
1896	Karin@r@vkarin0319."It's simple."
1897	Karin@r@vkarin0320."Neither of you have any proof, so you're even."
1898	Karin@r@vkarin0321."I believe you, Doremi… or rather, it's the opposite."
1899	Karin@r@vkarin0322."I don't believe you, Mina."
1900	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0346."…Karin…"
1901	Mina@r@vmina0291."…*sob"…"
1902	Mina@r@vmina0292."Why…? Why… Karin-chan…?"
1903	Mina@r@vmina0293."Forget about the others…. Why… why… would you, my closest friend, Karin-chan…"
1904	Karin@r@vkarin0323."You see, you… are the one… I can't fucking ever trust…"

1905	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0347."…D-Doremi! Are you okay?!"
1906	Doremi@r@vdoremi0248."I-I've been chosen to die…. As if I could be okay…"
1907	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0348."Either way, I could never abandon you, Doremi."
1908	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0349."There's barely any time, but let's look around for something until the last minute."
1909	Karin@r@vkarin0324."Th-that's right! Maybe there's an opening to escape out of, or some kind of tool, or maybe a key…"
1910	Mina@r@vmina0294."Time to look around, look around…! Mina and the others are friends, so we should look around for something until the last minute…!"
1911	Doremi@r@vdoremi0249."…Yeah. Hey everyone… can I have a second?"
1912	Doremi@r@vdoremi0250."I'm stuck on… that phrase you're all saying… ‘until the last minute.’"
1913	Mina@r@vmina0295."Eh? Stuck on, how?"
1914	Doremi@r@vdoremi0251."Certainly, that way of phrasing it means you'll do everything you can until the last minute, but…"
1915	Doremi@r@vdoremi0252."Hearing that in my position… it sounds like you'll give up at the last minute."
1916	Doremi@r@vdoremi0253."What I mean is… just when did our death game become a treasure hunt?"
1917	Doremi@r@vdoremi0254."Wasn't this death game supposed to be about everyone deciding, between the @b.@<Condemned@> and the @b.@<Joker@>, which one to let die, or did I get that wrong?!"
1918	Karin@r@vkarin0325."What the hell are you saying…? Are you saying we should just do what the culprit wants?"
1919	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0350."Yeah! Is it really so strange that we want to do everything we can to resist while there's still time, and look for a way all of us can survive together?"
1920	Doremi@r@vdoremi0255.@z150."EXACTLY, I'M TELLING YOU THAT'S STRANGE…!!"
1921	Doremi@r@vdoremi0256."The culprit never said a word about this being a treasure hunt! You're all totally missing the point by looking for something; it's a meaningless waste of time!!"
1922	Doremi@r@vdoremi0257."You're all either unintentionally half-assing it or patently full of crap!! You're saying you'll try to save everyone while you waste time on purpose!!"
1923	Mina@r@vmina0296."Wh-why would Mina and her friends do something like that?"
1924	Doremi@r@vdoremi0258."Until the last minute, while there's still time, just means wasting time. Then, in the end, this here is what you will go with;"
1925	Doremi@r@vdoremi0259."‘There's just no other way, Doremi, sorry.’ …That's what you'll say when you'll let me die!!"
1926	Doremi@r@vdoremi0260."‘We tried our very best, but there's no other way.’ You are only faking this treasure hunt so you can feel justified in that!!"
1927	Karin@r@vkarin0326."…Y-you don't really think we would… think that, do you?!"
1928	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0351."That's right!! We don't want to abandon anybody!"
1929	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0352."Wouldn't it be simple for us to survive if we were fine with abandoning you, Doremi?! But we don't want to abandon you, and that's why we're looking around like this!"
1930	Mina@r@vmina0297."I-if the way Mina and her friends said it was bad, then Mina apologizes. Saying ‘until the last minute’ had no deeper meaning…"
1931	Doremi@r@vdoremi0261.@z194."DON'T GIVE ME YOUR CRAP!!!!"
1932	Doremi@r@vdoremi0262.@z127."NO DEEPER MEANING, MY ASS!! YOU SURE THAT WASN'T YOUR ACTUAL FEELINGS SLIPPING OUT?!"
1933	Doremi@r@vdoremi0263.@z127."IF YOU REALLY, SERIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO ABANDON ME, YOU WOULDN'T FUCKING SAY ‘UNTIL THE LAST MINUUUUuTE!!!’"
1934	Mina@r@vmina0298."Then, then umm… what does Doremi-chan think should be done…?!"
1935	Doremi@r@vdoremi0264."Isn't it obvious?! It's either the @b.@<Condemned@> or the @b.@<Joker@>! I'm talking about deciding which one will be the sacrifice!"
1936	Doremi@r@vdoremi0265."Fuuka! You think you're fooling anyone with that innocent face?! The @b.@<Condemned@> and the @b.@<Joker@> are both on equal footing, aren't they?!"
1937	Doremi@r@vdoremi0266."It's me or you, Fuuka! The culprit made this death game to be about deciding who'll be the sacrifice!"
1938	Doremi@r@vdoremi0267."It's not fair to push the @b.@<Condemed@> role on me while you hold out feigning ignorance until the time's up!!"
1939	Doremi@r@vdoremi0268.@z132."HEY YOU, FUUKA!! I'M TALKING TO YOU, BITCH!! DON'T GIVE ME THAT STUUPID FACE LIKE YOU'RE SOME FUCKING BYSTANDEER!!!"
1940	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0353."…I-I'm not—"
1941	Doremi@r@vdoremi0269."Hey, Karin! Mina! I didn't say anything strange, did I?!"
1942	Karin@r@vkarin0327."B-but, deciding that we have to abandon one person is just…"
1943	Doremi@r@vdoremi0270."It's a fucking death game, so don't look, the other wayyyy!! Isn't that just abandoning me and being half-assed about it?!?!"
1944	Doremi@r@vdoremi0271."Each and every one of you cunts is just babbling nice sounding bullshit!! Even though you're obviously just figuring out how to let me die!!!"
1945	Mina@r@vmina0299."…Fufufu… ahahahahahahahaha."
1946	Doremi@r@vdoremi0272."…Huhh?"
1947	Mina@r@vmina0300."If the jig is up, that just speeds things aloong."
1948	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0354."M-Mina-chan…?"
1949	Mina@r@vmina0301."It's okay, Fuuka-chan doesn't have to keep making that ridiculous face either! Since um, it seems like this farce is over."
1950	Mina@r@vmina0302."Karin-chan too. Why does Karin-chan keep making that ‘I don't get it’ face for?"
1951	Karin@r@vkarin0328."No… I mean like, I really don't get…"
1952	Mina@r@vmina0303."Huh… Fuuka-chan, and Karin-chan too, are saying some nice things like they really mean it."
1953	Mina@r@vmina0304."But hey, Doremi-chan."
1954	Mina@r@vmina0305."Doremi-chan already said it's not fair. …So here it is. The fight's already started."
1955	Mina@r@vmina0306."No one wants to die. Everyone wants to survive together if they can."
1956	Mina@r@vmina0307."But it's not possible. If they don't abandon one person, there's no other way to survive…"
1957	Mina@r@vmina0308."So that's exactly why everyone is dressing it up in nice sounding words to trick you while they make you the sacrifice."
1958	Doremi@r@vdoremi0273."Y-you… how dare you… how can you just…!!"
1959	Mina@r@vmina0309."Well, Doremi-chan already said everyone is busted, so Mina is just stopping the farce for everyone. Mina thinks Doremi-chan is being selfish."
1960	Mina@r@vmina0310."After all. Doremi-chan is using nice words like ‘fair’ but she never even had the right to open her mouth to begin with."
1961	Doremi@r@vdoremi0274."…What are you trying to say?"
1962	Mina@r@vmina0311."Weeell. Mina was supposed to be reaally good friends with Doremi-chan, but…"
1963	Mina@r@vmina0312."To be honest, she hates Doremi-chan. For as long as they've known each other, Mina has aaalways hated Doremi-chan's guts!!"
1964	Mina@r@vmina0313."…There. That's what Mina wanted to say."
1965	Doremi@r@vdoremi0275."…Wha—"
1966	Mina@r@vmina0314."Hm? Did Doremi-chan not hear?"

1969	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0355."Calm down! Everything will be alright, Doremi! You know there's no way I'd abandon you!"
1970	Karin@r@vkarin0329."A-anyway, let's try searching the room top to bottom…!"
1971	Mina@r@vmina0315."If only something could be done… about these collars and chaiins… u… hng…!"
1972	Doremi@r@vdoremi0278."…Mina, stop."
1973	Doremi@r@vdoremi0279."You too, Karin…. No matter what you're looking for, it's not like you'll find anything."
1974	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0356."…But if we won't know if we don't try—"
1975	Doremi@r@vdoremi0280."You stop too, Fuuka. …If you could just, stop wasting time right now."
1976	Mina@r@vmina0316."…Then, how should the time be used…"
1977	Doremi@r@vdoremi0281."Earlier, we thoroughly investigated our own collars already, didn't we?"
1978	Doremi@r@vdoremi0282."We all have to understand that even if we found some tool, it wouldn't be enough to do anything with in just 5 minutes."
1979	Doremi@r@vdoremi0283."Unless I'm sorely mistaken, this death game, that the culprit went to such great lengths to set up, has no way out. There's no way we can just ignore the facts."
1980	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0357."…That, may be so, but…"
1981	Karin@r@vkarin0330."Then what the heck are we supposed to do…! Are you telling us to just fucking do what the culprit says…?!"
1982	Doremi@r@vdoremi0284."Quite frankly, I am."
1983	Doremi@r@vdoremi0285."We have to spend what little time the culprit gave us on his game."
1984	Doremi@r@vdoremi0286."Wasting time, panicking, and getting cornered into a hasty decision could prove fatal…"
1985	Mina@r@vmina0317."…The culprit's game… means…"
1986	Doremi@r@vdoremi0287."That's right. …It's either the @b.@<Condemned@>, me, or the @b.@<Joker@>, Karin. The game is to decide which of us to inflict the torture on…"
1987	Karin@r@vkarin0331."…I see. If a @b.@<Judge@> says not guilty, the @b.@<Joker@> becomes @b.@<Condemned@> next…"
1988	Doremi@r@vdoremi0288."The culprit said she'd be brought to the brink of death and feel all its agony. …I don't recall him saying that she would die."
1989	Doremi@r@vdoremi0289."But be that as it may… if we don't choose whether to inflict that terrible agony on me or on Karin…"
1990	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0358."Then all of us… are going to burn to death here…"
1991	Karin@r@vkarin0332."Y… you're right…"
1992	@rDeep down, Karin feels sickened.
1993	@rThe @b.@<Condemned@>, Doremi is supposed to start in the weakest position.
1994	@rHowever, with her clever phrasing, she has been able to make it sound like her position is equal to that of the @b.@<Joker@>.
1995	@r…This is no joke. She herself is not @b.@<Condemned@>. She doesn't want that role pushed onto her…
1996	Doremi@r@vdoremi0290."There's only a few minutes left. …It's me or Karin. I'd like to debate which of us must be @b.@<Condemned@>."

1998	Mina@r@vmina0318."………"
1999	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0359."Deciding which of you to make @b.@<Condemned@> is just… too…"
2000	@rA painfully heavy silence comes over them for a little bit.
2001	@rThe only sound that can be heard is that of the blue flames erupting from under the floor.
2002	@rAnd that sound… feels like it's gradually getting stronger with time, little by little…
2003	Doremi@r@vdoremi0291."At this rate, we're all gonna end up dead…. It pains me to say this but, everyone, let's do away with the pretense of being friends, just for now."
2004	Karin@r@vkarin0334."…Huhh… huhh…"
2005	Doremi@r@vdoremi0292."Fine… I guess I'll be the one to start. …I think it'd be better if you took my place, Karin."
2006	Karin@r@vkarin0335."W-Why's that?!"
2007	Doremi@r@vdoremi0293."The reason being… I think you have the sturdiest body here, Karin."

2009	Karin@r@vkarin0336."N-no, no, wait a second! I can't accept… a-a reason like that!"
2010	Mina@r@vmina0319."Yeah! Doing that to Karin-chan for a reason like that would be way too horrible!"
2011	Mina@r@vmina0320."Because of that, Mina… gives her most sincere apologies, but… she thinks the @b.@<Condemned@> should stay like this…"

2041	Doremi@r@vdoremi0305."I mean that pulling the torture lever will get the collars off."

2044	Doremi@r@vdoremi0307."Everybody should already understand how much labor and insanity went into building this room."

2057	Doremi@r@vdoremi0315."Mina is the @b.@<Joker@>."
2058	Doremi@r@vdoremi0316."The one and only way the @b.@<Condemned@> can survive is if the @b.@<Joker@> and the @b.@<Condemned@> switch places, as the result of a not guilty verdict."
2059	Doremi@r@vdoremi0317."But hey, Mina… don't worry about me. I wouldn't wish that on you, after all."
