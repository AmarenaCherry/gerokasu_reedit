1	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0001."Hng... Oww..."
2	Mina@r@vmina0001."Hmm...can't eat another bite..."
3	Doremi@r@vdoremi0001."...Where...are we...?"
4	Karin@r@vkarin0001.@z194."Wh-What the heeeeeell?!?!"
5	Karin@r@vkarin0002."Wha-what's this!? I-It won't come off!"
6	Mina@r@vmina0002.@z144."EEK?!?! What's going on, what's going on?! I'm scared, I'm scaaaaaared!!"
7	Doremi@r@vdoremi0002."Mina, you're all jumpy..."
8	Mina@r@vmina0003."What happened to Doremi-chan?! Oh no, Mina too?!?!"
9	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0002."W-We've been...collared and chained...?"
10	@rThe four girls notice an unusual feeling at the base of their necks.
11	@rFastened there is a rigid collar made of solid metal.
12	@rAnd fastened to those are cruel looking chains,@reach stretching into the darkness of the four corners of the square room.
13	@rRight under the part to which each chain is fastened,@ris what looks like a windup device.
14	@rNo matter what trick they might think of to take it off,@rit won't budge an inch…
15	Karin@r@vkarin0003."W-what kind of sick joke is this...?!"
16	Karin@r@vkarin0004."Where's the camera?! Isn't that what this is? Isn't this a prank?! Of course they'd go way overboard like this! Dammit, come on out, director!!"
17	Mina@r@vmina0004."...This collar hurts... It won't come off...someone, get it off..."
18	Doremi@r@vdoremi0003."It doesn't... feel like a joke..."
19	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0003."...Calm down, everyone. Let's take a look around."
20	@rKarin seemed convinced this was but a tasteless prank, but Fuuka didn't share her opinion.
21	@r...After all, no matter how elaborate a haunted house might be, a certain feeling of ‘cheapness’ should still come through.
22	@rThat trait is completely absent here.
23	@rThe collars stuck on their necks, the chains attached to them...are not fake, but uncompromising restraints made of genuine, solid steel.
24	Karin@r@vkarin0005."Wait, don't tell me this is, like, for real?!"
25	Karin@r@vkarin0006."Don't tell me we're, like, actually...locked up by some psychopath like in those horror movies?!"
26	Doremi@r@vdoremi0004."...Oh, you mean the ones where a video starts playing and the mastermind goes ‘let's play a game’?"
27	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0004."Hahaha... Well, it sure does seem that way..."
28	Mina@r@vmina0005."So this is...not a joke…? It's really, actually...real?"
29	@rAs their eyes adjust to the darkness, they start to understand the reality of the situation.
30	@rThe mysterious room they're in seems to be just a bit smaller than an average classroom.
31	@rThere are no windows, and it's unclear whether they're above or below ground.
32	Karin@r@vkarin0007."Wh-Where even are we? ...A factory?"
33	Doremi@r@vdoremi0005."...That was my first guess too. From the smell and atmosphere and stuff."
34	@rIt's a dreary room with walls, floors, and ceiling all covered by a metallic patchwork.
35	@rHowever, there's also an uncharacteristic warmth.
36	@rFrom somewhere far away, a boiler groans out a message of warmth. …At least, one can be felt.
37	@rAlthough the floor — just like the walls — is covered by the patchwork, a metallic mesh spreads out above it like a chain link fence.
38	@rThe girls have seen a mesh fence used as a barrier before, but this is the first time they've seen one spread out across the floor...
39	Mina@r@vmina0006.@z150."Hey, hey, hey! What's with those chairs?! Those creepy looking chairs?!"
40	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0005."...Our chains are connected to it."
41	@rIn the four corners of the room are standing ominous chairs.
42	@rThe simplest description would be to say they're shaped like dentist chairs.
43	@rBut without any of the soft cushioning.
44	@rThe unsettling chairs appear to be made of rusted pieces of metal...giving them a cruel vibe.
45	@rFurthermore, the chains on the girls' collars, each extending into the four corners of the room, connect to those chairs.
46	@rSince the chains have a good deal of length to them, the girls can still freely move around.
47	@r...However, if there were a device to reel in these chains...they would be forced to sit in them.
48	Doremi@r@vdoremi0006."...These chairs have arm and leg shackles."
49	Doremi@r@vdoremi0007."If you sat down, they'd likely snap shut, like ‘clank!’..."
50	Karin@r@vkarin0008."I've never seen such nasty looking chairs before...except in manga...haha..."
51	Mina@r@vmina0007."Hey, hey! This has to be a door, right?!"
52	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0006."...There's no handle on it."
53	Karin@r@vkarin0009."Hng, ghh, gh...!!"
54	Doremi@r@vdoremi0008."Don't strain yourself... Clearly, it's no use."
55	@rIt seems to be a tightly shut elevator door, so Karin is using her nails to try to get it open.
56	@rHowever, as this situation was clearly designed to confine them, …this certainly won't be enough to open it.
57	@rAnd even if, say, she were to get it open… there'd still be nothing she could do about the chain on her collar…
58	@rAt this point, suddenly, an eerie mechanical sound can be heard somewhere far away, perhaps from something metallic.
59	@rWhatever kind of machine it is, it must be running now. And its sound is getting loud enough to notice…
60	@rSuddenly, something gigantic fell from the ceiling…!!!
61	@rThe four of them are rendered speechless at this sudden drop-in…
62	Mina@r@vmina0008.@z150."WHAT? WHAT, WHAT? …I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMOORE, aAaAaAAAHN…!!"
63	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0007."A… cage…?"
64	Karin@r@vkarin0010."…Someone's inside! There's someone there…!"
65	Doremi@r@vdoremi0009."…A child…"
66	@rThe thing that suddenly appeared is, …a big cage.
67	@rIt came down from the ceiling, hanging from chains, and is now swaying about a meter above the floor….
68	@rAnd inside of it is the figure of a child lying down.
69	@rNo older than an elementary schooler. …And they can't tell much about the child aside from the white robe, like the ones they make you wear for an examination in a hospital.
70	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0008."…Hey, you there… are you okay…?!"
71	Mina@r@vmina0009."T-they're moving… they're alive…!"
72	@rThe child sits up at a leisurely pace. The girls are bracing themselves without quite realizing it.
73	@rIt's probably… a boy.
74	@rHe has an expression of childlike innocence, his eyes displaying a severe drowsiness, as if he has just awoken from a deep slumber.
75	@rIt's as if he doesn't even realize where he is, much less what extreme circumstances these are…
76	Doremi@r@vdoremi0010."…This kid's cage… has no entrance or exit…"
77	Karin@r@vkarin0011."I-it's true…. But then, like, how'd he get in there?!"
78	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0009."…Maybe it was welded shut… after he was put inside…?"
79	Mina@r@vmina0010."Hey, hey… is the little boy okay? Is he hurt or anything…?"
80	Boy@r@vm_shou0001."………"
81	@rThe boy in the white robe looks around at his surroundings vacantly, with a blank expression on his face.
82	@rIs it possible his consciousness is still dulled from some powerful anesthetic, or something like that?
83	@rHe's confined in a cage. And even as he peers at the girls' concerned faces through the bars, there's no emotions to be seen underneath his blank face…
84	Boy@r@vm_shou0002."………"
85	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0010."Hey you, what's your name…? Why're you here…?"
86	Boy@r@vm_shou0003."………"
87	Doremi@r@vdoremi0011."…Can he, not hear us…?"
88	Karin@r@vkarin0012."Something's not right with this kid…"
89	Mina@r@vmina0011."It's kinda… scary…"
90	@r@z95.Although they're sure they've met the boy's gaze several times now, their concern is starting to feel foolish, and he doesn't display the slightest emotion or acknowledgement in response.
91	@rHis mild eeriness aside, he, too, is probably a prisoner here just like the girls, no, definitely….
92	Karin@r@vkarin0013."If this were that kind of movie, this kid would end up being the final boss, right?"
93	Mina@r@vmina0012."Noo, don't say things like that! Mina's scaaaared…"
94	Doremi@r@vdoremi0012."…Karin's lips seem to have finally loosened…"
95	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0011."Let's calm down, everyone."
96	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0012."Where are we? …Actually, how did we end up in a place like this?"
97	Karin@r@vkarin0014."………"
98	Doremi@r@vdoremi0013."…I have no memory of anything after we all left school together."
99	Mina@r@vmina0013."Eh? Left school? Mina can't remember anything since around lunch break…"
100	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0013."I certainly remember getting to homeroom on Tuesday…"
101	Karin@r@vkarin0015."Man… we can't even remember when or by who we got kidnapped…"
102	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0014."Let's put our heads together and think, everybody. Whatever the case may be, we've gotta think of a way out of here…!"
103	Voice@r@vm_koe0001.@z150."ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU THE WAY."
104	@rIt's a sinister voice they suddenly heard from somewhere, augmented by a voice changer.
105	@rIn response to this voice, the caged boy's whole body shivers, and for the first time, his movements suggest the presence of emotion…
106	Karin@r@vkarin0016."Hehe… that's… kind of a clich@u233.d villain voice if you ask me…"
107	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0015."Shhh, quiet…"
108	Voice@r@vm_koe0002."You four girls. I've prepared two possible fates@rfor you."
109	Voice@r@vm_koe0003."The first fate: everyone in this room dies."
110	Mina@r@vmina0014.@z172."N-NOOOoOOOOoOO!!!"
111	Voice@r@vm_koe0004."The other fate: only three of you girls are saved."
112	Doremi@r@vdoremi0014."…Three of us…?"
113	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0016."P-please, wait! Can the child in this cage not be saved…?!"
114	Voice@r@vm_koe0005."This is a trial to test the fates of you girls."
115	Voice@r@vm_koe0006."No matter what fate you choose,@rit will have no effect on the fate of that boy."
116	Voice@r@vm_koe0007."When the time comes, only death awaits, for every one of you in the room."
117	Karin@r@vkarin0017."…R-right, riight. So it's a death game with a time limit, is that it?"
118	Karin@r@vkarin0018."That's totally it, you see this dumb plot everywhere. What a cheap scenario…. W-we should complain to the sponsors…"
119	@rThe boy inside the cage, no matter how much he struggles, won't be given a fate where he survives.
120	@rHe's listening intently to the sinister voice with a seeming meekness, but… he doesn't look like he understands how precariously his own life hangs in the balance.
121	@r…But now is the time to worry about yourself instead of other people.
122	Voice@r@vm_koe0008."Boy. Search the pocket of your garment. You should find four cards."
123	Boy@r@vm_shou0004."………"
124	@rThe boy's first response to this voice is to search the pocket of his white robe, as ordered.
125	@r…They're a little startled. They thought maybe words wouldn't reach him, or maybe he couldn't even hear at all.
126	@rHowever, his eyes kept their dulled appearance.
127	@rIt's almost as if he's under a curse so that he can't hear anything except the words of the sinister voice…
128	Voice@r@vm_koe0009."So you've found them. Well then, deal out one to each of the girls."
129	@rThe boy obeys the voice and passes out one card to each of them, his eyes keeping their dulled appearance.
130	@rIn spite of this… the girls can't sense any awareness from the boy.
131	Doremi@r@vdoremi0015."…Weird cards. …They look like tarot cards…"
132	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0017."No. …There aren't any tarot cards like this."
133	Voice@r@vm_koe0010."There are three kinds of cards you've been given. Allow me to explain each of them."
134	Voice@r@vm_koe0011."Two of them are @b.@<Judges@>."
135	Voice@r@vm_koe0012."One of them is the @b.@<Joker@>."
136	Voice@r@vm_koe0013."One of them is the @b.@<Condemned@>…"
137	Voice@r@vm_koe0014."Your fates will be tested in accordance with the roles of each card, to determine whether or not you can survive."
138	Voice@r@vm_koe0015."This will not be explained more than once. If you want even a small chance of survival, you had better not miss any detail."
139	Voice@r@vm_koe0016."Firstly, the two @b.@<Judges@>."
140	Voice@r@vm_koe0017."The @b.@<Judges@> play two roles. One of them is to declare the @b.@<Condemned@> either guilty or not guilty."
141	Voice@r@vm_koe0018."If the @b.@<Condemned@> is declared guilty, a lever for torturing her will appear on her seat."
142	Voice@r@vm_koe0019."If the @b.@<Condemned@> is declared not guilty, she will immediately switch places with the @b.@<Joker@>."
143	Voice@r@vm_koe0020."She may be declared guilty or not guilty at any time, any number of times."
144	Voice@r@vm_koe0021."This means, for example, that even if a guilty verdict is handed down, it may be changed to a not guilty verdict."
145	Voice@r@vm_koe0022."However, the right to declare her guilty or not guilty lies only with the @b.@<Judge@> who made the initial verdict."
146	Voice@r@vm_koe0023."In other words, this means that when one @b.@<Judge@> makes her judgement, the other @b.@<Judge@> loses her right to make a verdict."
147	Voice@r@vm_koe0024."In exchange, only the hand of the @b.@<Judge@> who loses the right to make that verdict may operate the lever for the torture."
148	Voice@r@vm_koe0025."When the lever is pulled down, the torture device will bring the @b.@<Condemned@> to the brink of death, and she will feel all its agony."
149	Voice@r@vm_koe0026."Then, with the lever pulled all the way down, keys will release the collars on three of you, excluding the @b.@<Condemned,@> and the door to the elevator will be opened."
150	Voice@r@vm_koe0027."This is the only way by which three of you girls may survive."
151	@rIn other words… it's like this.
152	@rOne of the two @b.@<Judges@> will first make a guilty declaration.
153	@rWhen she does, a torture lever will appear,@rwhich the other @b.@<Judge@> may operate.
# ignore oversized
154	@rIf the torture lever is pulled all the way down, three of the girls,@rexcluding the @b.@<Condemned,@> will be released from their collars, and the elevator door will be opened…
155	Voice@r@vm_koe0028."In summary, this is a trial by which the two @b.@<Judges@> among you will make and carry out the decision to abandon one among you."
156	Karin@r@vkarin0019."Like hell anyone would make a, d-decision like that!"
157	Voice@r@vm_koe0029."Naturally, if no decision is made, there is but one alternative."
158	Voice@r@vm_koe0030."Bear in mind, the time allotted for making a decision is limited."
159	@rAt this point, a metal plate above the elevator door topples down with a clanking sound.
160	@rBehind it… an analog clock of rusted metal, which looks like it fits right in with this room, is revealed.
161	@rHowever, it only has 1 hand, a long hand.
162	@rAnd that hand is currently pointing to 11.
163	Voice@r@vm_koe0031."That time is five minutes."
164	Doremi@r@vdoremi0016."…That's way too short…"
165	Mina@r@vmina0015."Wh-what if the five minutes run out…?"
166	Voice@r@vm_koe0032."All of you are to die, obviously."
167	Karin@r@vkarin0020."S… s,"
168	Karin@r@vkarin0021."Stop fucking with—@z72.AGHH…@z100."
169	@rStop fucking with us… That must've been what she wanted to say.
170	@rHowever, they've all been assaulted by a kind of terror… that has broken and shattered even the normally strong-willed Karin's heart.
171	@rThey all feel their legs rattling as they tremble.
172	@rDeath games and the like are a pretty trendy genre lately… by now everyone must've seen seen at least one of these in a manga or something.
173	@rThey might have thought… that this kind of thing is getting half-assed and stale lately, but… this time it's their own lives on the line.
174	@r…The terror of that is immeasurable….
175	Voice@r@vm_koe0033."With that out of the way, I will now set the timer for five minutes."
176	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0018.@z150."P-PLEASE, WAIT! YOU HAVEN'T EXPLAINED EVERYTHING!"
177	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0019."What does the @b.@<Joker@> do? What does the @b.@<Condemned@> do?!"
178	Voice@r@vm_koe0034."The role of the @b.@<Joker@> demands nothing. Rather, she should try not to lose heart, and should see to it that she herself is not made the @b.@<Condemned@>."
179	@rThe @b.@<Judges@> have to make a cruel decision about the @b.@<Condemned@>.
180	@rEven if the @b.@<Joker@> is perchance made the @b.@<Condemned,@> the two @b.@<Judges@> will have to quickly torture and execute her…
181	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0020."This is… so cruel…"
182	Karin@r@vkarin0022."Um, hey, what about the @b.@<Condemned@>…?!"
183	Doremi@r@vdoremi0017."…There is no need to ask…"
184	Doremi@r@vdoremi0018."She has to push her own @b.@<Condemned@> role onto the @b.@<Joker@>, by convincing the @b.@<Judges@> to save her and kill the @b.@<Joker@> instead…. That's all she can do."
185	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0021."In other words… the @b.@<Joker@> and the @b.@<Condemned@> each has to argue against the other, so that one survives and her opponent is killed in her place…"
186	Mina@r@vmina0016."Wh… what is this…? Why…?"
187	Mina@r@vmina0017."Even though Mina and her friends… have always, always been a group of 4 close friends… ever since elementary school…"
188	Mina@r@vmina0018."How come… they have to do something so scaryyyyyy!!!"
189	Karin@r@vkarin0023."S… s… s,"
190	Karin@r@vkarin0024."stop… fucking… with… agh…"
191	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0022."…How could this…"
