1	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0001."Hng... Oww..."
2	Mina@r@vmina0001."Hmm...can't eat another bite..."
3	Doremi@r@vdoremi0001."...Where...are we...?"
4	Karin@r@vkarin0001.@z194."Wh-What the heeeeeell?!?!"
5	Karin@r@vkarin0002."Wha-What's this!? I-It won't come off!"
6	Mina@r@vmina0002.@z144."EEK?!?! What's going on, what's going on?! I'm scared, I'm scaaaaaared!!"
7	Doremi@r@vdoremi0002."Mina, you're all jumpy..."
8	Mina@r@vmina0003."What happened to Doremi-chan?! Oh no, Mina too?!?!"
9	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0002."W-We've been...collared and chained...?"
10	@rThe four girls noticed an unusual feeling at the base of their necks.
11	@rFastened there was a rigid collar made of solid metal.
12	@rAnd fastened to those were cruel looking chains,@reach stretching into the darkness of the four corners of the square room.
13	@rRight under the part to which each chain is fastened,@rwas what looks like a windup device.
14	@rNo matter what trick they might think of to take it off,@rit wouldn't budge an inch...
15	Karin@r@vkarin0003."W-what kind of sick joke is this...?!"
16	Karin@r@vkarin0004."Where's the camera?! Isn't that what this is? Isn't this a prank?! Of course they'd go way overboard like this! Dammit, come on out, director!!"
17	Mina@r@vmina0004."...This collar hurts... It won't come off...someone, get it off..."
18	Doremi@r@vdoremi0003."It doesn't...look like a joke..."
19	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0003."...Calm down, everyone. Let's take a look around."
20	@rKarin seemed convinced this was but a tasteless prank, but Fuuka didn't share her opinion.
21	@r...After all, no matter how elaborate a haunted house might be, a certain feeling of ‘cheapness’ should still come through.
22	@rThat trait is completely absent here.
23	@rThe collars stuck on their necks, the chains attached to them...are not fake, but uncompromising restraints made of genuine, solid steel.
24	Karin@r@vkarin0005."Wait, don't tell me this is, like, for real?!"
25	Karin@r@vkarin0006."Are we, like, actually...locked up by some psychopath like in those horror movies?!"
26	Doremi@r@vdoremi0004."...Oh, you mean the ones where a video starts playing and the mastermind goes ‘let's play a game’?"
27	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0004."Hahaha... Well, it sure does seem that way..."
28	Mina@r@vmina0005."So this is...not a joke…? It's really, actually...real?"
29	@rAs their eyes adjust to the darkness, they start to understand the reality of the situation.
30	@rThe mysterious room they're in seems to be just a bit smaller than an average classroom.
31	@rThere are no windows, and it's unclear whether they're above or below ground.
32	Karin@r@vkarin0007."Wh-Where even are we? ...A factory?"
33	Doremi@r@vdoremi0005."...That was my first guess too. From the smell and atmosphere and stuff."
34	@rA dreary room with walls, floors, and ceiling all covered by a metallic patchwork.
35	@rHowever, there was also an uncharacteristic warmth to it.
36	@rFrom somewhere far away, a boiler groaned out a message of warmth... At least, one can be felt.
37	@rAlthough the floor — just like the walls — were covered by patchwork, a metallic mesh spread out above it like a chain link fence.
38	@rThe girls had seen a mesh fence used as a barrier before, but this was their first time seeing one spread out across the floor...
39	Mina@r@vmina0006.@z150."Hey, hey, hey! What's with those chairs?! Those creepy looking chairs?!"
40	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0005."...Our chains are connected to it."
41	@rIn the four corners of the room were standing ominous chairs.
42	@rThe simplest description would be to say they're shaped like dentist chairs.
43	@rBut without any of the soft cushioning.
44	@rThe unsettling chairs appeared to be made of rusted pieces of metal...giving them a cruel vibe.
45	@rFurthermore, the chains on the girls' collars, each extending into the four corners of the room, connected to those chairs.
46	@rSince the chains had a good deal of length to them, the girls could still freely move around.
47	@r...However, if there were a device to reel in these chains...they would be forced to sit in them.
48	Doremi@r@vdoremi0006."...These chairs have arm and leg shackles."
49	Doremi@r@vdoremi0007."If one sat down, they'd likely snap shut, like ‘clank!’..."
50	Karin@r@vkarin0008."I've never seen such nasty looking chairs before...except in manga...haha..."
51	Mina@r@vmina0007."Hey, hey! This has to be a door, right?!"
52	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0006."...There's no handle on it."
53	Karin@r@vkarin0009."Hng, ghh, gh...!!"
54	Doremi@r@vdoremi0008."Don't strain yourself... Clearly, it's no use."
55	@rIt appeared to be a tightly shut elevator door, Karin used her nails to try to get it open.
56	@rHowever, this room was clearly designed to confine them... This certainly wouldn't be enough to open it.
57	@rAnd even if she were to succeed...there'd still be nothing she could do about the chain on her collar...
58	@rAt that moment, an eerie mechanical sound, perhaps from something metallic, could be heard somewhere far away.
59	@rWhatever kind of machine it was, it must be running now. And its sound is getting loud enough to notice...
60	@rSuddenly, something gigantic fell from the ceiling...!
61	@rThe four of them were rendered speechless at this sudden drop-in...
62	Mina@r@vmina0008.@z150."WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?! ...I can't take this anymoooore, waaaaaah!"
63	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0007."Is...that a cage?"
64	Karin@r@vkarin0010."...Someone's inside! There's someone there!"
65	Doremi@r@vdoremi0009."...A child."
66	@rWhat suddenly appeared was...a giant cage.
67	@rIt came down from above, now still hanging from chains, and is now swaying about a meter above the floor...
68	@rAnd inside of it is the figure of a child lying down.
69	@rThey were no older than an elementary schooler... And they can't tell much about the child aside from their clothing — a white robe like the ones worn by hospital patients.
70	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0008."...Hey, you there. Are you okay?!"
71	Mina@r@vmina0009."T-They're moving... They're alive...!"
72	@rThe child sat up at a leisurely pace. The girls unconsciously braced themselves up.
73	@rIt was...a boy. Most likely.
74	@rHis face inspired a child-like innocence, his eyes displaying a severe drowsiness — as if he had just awoken from a deep slumber.
75	@rIt's as if he wasn't aware of where he was, or how strange the circumstances were...
76	Doremi@r@vdoremi0010."This kid's cage...has no entrance or exit."
77	Karin@r@vkarin0011."T-That's true... But then, how'd he get in there?!"
78	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0009."Maybe it was welded shut...after they put him inside...?"
79	Mina@r@vmina0010."Hey, hey...is the little boy okay? Is he hurt or anything...?"
80	Boy@r@vm_shou0001."........."
81	@rThe boy in the white robe vacantly looked at his surroundings, a blank expression on his face.
82	@rCould his mind be perhaps dulled by the aftereffects of a strong anesthetic?
83	@rEven though he's trapped in a cage, and looking at the worried faces of those around him...his face doesn't budge an inch."
84	Boy@r@vm_shou0002."........."
85	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0010."Hey, you, what's your name? Why are you here...?"
86	Boy@r@vm_shou0003."........."
87	Doremi@r@vdoremi0011."Can he, not hear us...?"
88	Karin@r@vkarin0012."Something's not right with this kid..."
89	Mina@r@vmina0011."It's...kinda scary."
90	@r@z95.Although their eyes have met several times now, he has yet to display the slightest hint of emotion of acknowledgement.
91	@rBut, his mild eerieness aside, he was likely in the same boat as everyone else — a captive...
92	Karin@r@vkarin0013."If this were a movie, this kid would end up being the main antagonist, right?"
93	Mina@r@vmina0012."Noooo, don't say things like that! Mina's scaaaared..."
94	Doremi@r@vdoremi0012."...Glad to see you're still able to make jokes like this."
95	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0011."Everyone, calm down."
96	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0012."What is this place? ...Actually, how did we end up here?"
97	Karin@r@vkarin0014."........."
98	Doremi@r@vdoremi0013."...I have no memory of anything after we left school together."
99	Mina@r@vmina0013."Eh? Left school? Mina can't remember anything since around lunch break..."
100	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0013."I at least remember getting to class on Tuesday..."
101	Karin@r@vkarin0015."Man...we can't even remember when or by who we got kidnapped..."
102	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0014."Everyone, let's put our heads together and think. In any case, we have to find a way out of here!"
103	Voice@r@vm_koe0001.@z150."Allow me to tell you the way."
104	@rA sinister voice, seemingly altered by a voice changer, suddenly appeared.
105	@rIn reaction, the boy in the cage's whole body shivered, and for the first time, his movements suggest the presence of emotion…
106	Karin@r@vkarin0016."Hehe...that's...kind of a clich@u233.d villain voice if you ask me..."
107	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0015."Shhh, quiet..."
108	Voice@r@vm_koe0002."Two possible fates stand before you."
109	Voice@r@vm_koe0003."The first one: everyone in this room dies."
110	Mina@r@vmina0014.@z172."N-NOOOOOOOOO!!!"
111	Voice@r@vm_koe0004."The second one: only three among your four will be saved."
112	Doremi@r@vdoremi0014."...Only three?"
113	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0016."P-Please, wait! What about the child in the cage...?!"
114	Voice@r@vm_koe0005."This trial was made to test you four only."
115	Voice@r@vm_koe0006."No matter what fate you choose,@rit will not influence his."
116	Voice@r@vm_koe0007."When the time comes, only death awaits those left in this room."
117	Karin@r@vkarin0017."...R-Right, riiiight. So, a death game with a time limit, eh?"
118	Karin@r@vkarin0018."Yep, must be that, you see this dumb plot everywhere. What a cheap scenario... W-We should go complain to the sponsors..."
119	@rNo matter how much he would struggle, the boy in the cage's fate was already sealed.
120	@rHe's listening intently to the sinister voice with a seeming meekness, but… he doesn't look like he understands how precariously his own life hangs in the balance.
121	@r...But now was not the time to worry about other people.
122	Voice@r@vm_koe0008."Boy. Search the pockets of your garment. You should find four cards."
123	Boy@r@vm_shou0004."........."
124	@rHis first act was to search the insides of his pockets, as the voice ordered him to.
125	@r...The others are a little startled. They thought maybe words wouldn't reach him, or maybe he couldn't even hear at all.
126	@rHis eyes, however, kept their dulled appearance.
127	@rAlmost as if he was under a curse so that he can't hear anything except the words of the sinister voice…
128	Voice@r@vm_koe0009."So you've found them. Now, give one to each of the girls."
129	@rThe boy obeyed, passing out one card to each of them, without any change in his expression.
130	@rIn spite of this… the girls can't sense any awareness from the boy.
131	Doremi@r@vdoremi0015."…Weird cards. …They look like tarot cards…"
132	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0017."No. …There aren't any tarot cards like this."
133	Voice@r@vm_koe0010."There are three kinds of cards you've been given. Allow me to explain each of them."
134	Voice@r@vm_koe0011."Two of them are @b.@<Judge@> cards."
135	Voice@r@vm_koe0012."One of them is a @b.@<Joker@> card."
136	Voice@r@vm_koe0013."One of them is a @b.@<Condemned@> card..."
137	Voice@r@vm_koe0014."Your fates will be tested in accordance with the roles of each card, to determine whether or not you can survive."
138	Voice@r@vm_koe0015."I will give this explanation only once. If you want even a small chance of survival, I suggest you do not miss any detail."
139	Voice@r@vm_koe0016."First, the two @b.@<Judge@> cards."
140	Voice@r@vm_koe0017."The @b.@<Judges@> play two roles. One is to declare the @b.@<Condemned@> either Guilty or Not Guilty."
141	Voice@r@vm_koe0018."If the @b.@<Condemned@> is declared Guilty, a lever for torturing her will appear on her seat."
142	Voice@r@vm_koe0019."If the @b.@<Condemned@> is declared Not Guilty, she will immediately switch places with the @b.@<Joker@>."
143	Voice@r@vm_koe0020."She may be declared Guilty or Not Guilty at any time, as many times as desired."
144	Voice@r@vm_koe0021."This means that, even if a Guilty verdict is handed down, it may be changed to a Not Guilty verdict."
145	Voice@r@vm_koe0022."However, the right to make a verdict lies only with the @b.@<Judge@> who made the initial verdict."
146	Voice@r@vm_koe0023."In other words, this means that when one @b.@<Judge@> gives her judgement, the other @b.@<Judge@> loses her power to give one."
147	Voice@r@vm_koe0024."In exchange, only the hand of the @b.@<Judge@> who lost the right to make a verdict may operate the torture lever."
148	Voice@r@vm_koe0025."If the lever is pulled down, the torture device will bring the @b.@<Condemned@> to the brink of death, and she will feel all its agony."
149	Voice@r@vm_koe0026."Then, once the lever is pulled all the way down, keys will release the collars on three of you, excluding the @b.@<Condemned,@> and the door to the elevator will open."
150	Voice@r@vm_koe0027."This is the only way by which three of you girls may survive."
151	@rTo summarize...
152	@rOne of the two @b.@<Judges@> must make a Guilty verdict.
153	@rWhen she does, a torture lever will appear,@rwhich the other @b.@<Judge@> may operate.
# ignore oversized
154	@rIf the torture lever is pulled all the way down, three of the girls,@rexcluding the @b.@<Condemned,@> will be released from their collars, and the elevator door will be opened...
155	Voice@r@vm_koe0028."In summary, this is a trial by which the two @b.@<Judges@> among you will make and carry out the decision to abandon one of you."
156	Karin@r@vkarin0019."Like hell anyone would make a d-decision like that!"
157	Voice@r@vm_koe0029."Naturally, if no decision is made, there is but one alternative."
158	Voice@r@vm_koe0030."But, bear in mind, the allotted time is limited."
159	@rAt that moment, a metal plate above the elevator door toppled down with a clanking sound.
160	@rBehind it...an analog clock in rusted metal, matching the aesthetic of the room.
161	@rHowever, it only has one hand — a minute hand.
162	@rAnd that hand is currently pointing to 11.
163	Voice@r@vm_koe0031."You have five minutes."
164	Doremi@r@vdoremi0016."...That's way too short."
165	Mina@r@vmina0015."Wh-What if Mina and her friends run out of time?"
166	Voice@r@vm_koe0032."Then you all die."
167	Karin@r@vkarin0020."D... D—"
168	Karin@r@vkarin0021."Don't mess with—@z72.argh…@z100."
169	@rDon't mess with us... That must've been what she wanted to say.
170	@rBut they were now assaulted by terror...a terror powerful enough to shatter even the strong-willed Karin's confidence.
171	@rThey all felt their legs rattling under the fear.
172	@rDeath games and the like were a pretty trendy genre lately...by now, everyone would've seen seen at least one of in a manga or something.
173	@rThey might have thought… that this kind of thing is getting half-assed and stale lately, but… this time it's their own lives on the line.
174	@r…The terror of that is immeasurable….
175	Voice@r@vm_koe0033."With that out of the way, I will now set the timer for five minutes."
176	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0018.@z150."P-Please, wait! You haven't explained everything!"
177	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0019."What does the @b.@<Joker@> do? And what about the @b.@<Condemned@>?!"
178	Voice@r@vm_koe0034."Nothing is required of the @b.@<Joker@>. At most, all she can do is try and hold on to her role as best as she can." 
179	@rThe @b.@<Judges@> have to take a cruel decision regarding the @b.@<Condemned@>.
180	@rEven if the @b.@<Joker@> swapped roles with her, the two @b.@<Judges@> would still have to torture and execute her...
181	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0020."This is...so cruel..."
182	Karin@r@vkarin0022."Um, hey, what about the @b.@<Condemned@>...?!"
183	Doremi@r@vdoremi0017."...It's obvious."
184	Doremi@r@vdoremi0018."She has to push her own role onto the @b.@<Joker@>, by convincing the @b.@<Judges@> to save her and kill the @b.@<Joker@> instead... That's all she can do."
185	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0021."In other words...the @b.@<Joker@> and the @b.@<Condemned@> each have to argue against the other, so that one of them may survive..."
186	Mina@r@vmina0016."Wh...what's happening? Why...?"
187	Mina@r@vmina0017."Even though Mina and her friends...have always, always been together...ever since elementary school..."
188	Mina@r@vmina0018."Why must they...do something so scaryyyyyy!!!"
189	Karin@r@vkarin0023."D...d...d,"
190	Karin@r@vkarin0024."don't...mess...with...agh..."
191	Fuuka@r@vfuuka0022."How could this..."
